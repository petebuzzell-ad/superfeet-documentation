We recognize that some people have various allergies to different chemicals, materials and adhesives – we strive to manufacture products that do not contain any unnecessary chemicals, materials or adhesives.  <\/p><ul><li>We utilize quality materials throughout our manufacturing process and have tested our materials extensively. We test to ensure that all our products meet the requirements contained in the following regulations: CPSC requirements for Lead, heavy elements and Phthalates, the European REACH Chemical restriction standard and also California Prop. 65 hazardous chemical list.<\/li><li>Allergenics are a unique field and are based on individual cases. Given the large range of potential allergenics and how they affect an individual, we cannot test for every case. We endeavor to make our insoles as hypo-allergenic as reasonably possible within the confines of our manufacturing process, but since every allergy is different – whether caused by direct contact, proximity or in combination with other products – we cannot guarantee to you that our insoles are 100% hypo-allergenic based on your individual concerns and sensitivity.<\/li><li>Latex is one of the most common questions we are asked about. We manufacture our insoles and packaging with no Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) ingredients. With no FDA approved test for natural rubber latex we work closely with our supply chain to document that this ingredient is not used in our insole products but ultimately have to rely on our supply chain for this information since we cannot independently test for this.<\/li><\/ul><p>If you know that you may have a chemical sensitivity, we recommend that you try one of our All-Purpose products (All-Purpose Support High Arch, All-Purpose Support Medium Arch, All-Purpose Support Low Arch etc.) as these insoles contain the least amount of materials or potential irritants (however, we are not representing that these All-Purpose products are allergen free, they are just the products in our Superfeet line that would have the least amount of allergens for most persons).<\/p><ul><li>The All-Purpose products are composed primarily of Polyester fabric top cover, Polyethylene foam, Polypropylene plastic cap and an EVA based adhesive. Our other insoles and footwear, while similar, do have additional materials and adhesives and again, depending on the nature of your sensitivity and individual case, may not be an appropriate choice for you.<\/li><\/ul><p>Please discuss with your health care provider if you have any further questions or issues, as they are the most qualified to guide you in choosing the best product for you and your individual circumstance.<\/p>",
