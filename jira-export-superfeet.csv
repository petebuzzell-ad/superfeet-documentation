","10/14/25, 1:23 PM (EST) - Valerie Vos: [~accountid:5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c] I’ve spent some time looking into this and wanted to get your feedback on the preferred solution. Here are my findings:

# In {{product.work-memory-foam.json}}, there is this corresponding JSON {{""size_chart_page"": ""work-memory-foam-size-chart""}} (line 74). For other products, the value for {{size_chart_page}} is just {{size-chart}}. This value corresponds to the URL of the size chart page to display to the user for that product. 
# The logic behind where the search is directed looks like it’s powered by Searchspring. I think what’s happening is that pages are prioritized first, and if there isn’t a page match, then the search page would be shown along with the user’s query.
# In this case, the query {{work memory foam}} does match the page with the URL “work-memory-foam-size-chart”, so I believe this is why this particular search leads the user to this page instead of the search page.

Potential solutions:

# Perhaps a redirect could be set up in Searchspring to account for the scenario where the user searches for “work memory foam”
# The Work Memory Foam Size Chart page could be renamed so that it doesn’t match the user’s search query; not sure if renaming to {{size-chart-work-memory-foam}} would work, or if it would need to be something like {{wmf-size-chart}} where the keyword does not match at all.
## In this case, a redirect may need to be set up from {{work-memory-foam-size-chart}} to the new URL, and this may need to be re-indexed in SearchSpring to pick up the content change. 
# The size chart page could be expanded where the initial size chart shows first, then below it are the size charts for other particular products. That way there isn’t a different size chart page for each product.
## Note that based on what I’ve seen in the code, it looks like the size chart page only shows if the user has JavaScript disabled. If JavaScript is enabled, then a modal with size chart info displays instead and the user remains on the current page (i.e. PDP).
# We could reach out to the Searchspring team to see if there is a config/setting that could be adjusted on our side. I reviewed all of the configs and am not finding anything that would address this scenario, but someone from Searchspring may be able to offer some additional insights.

In a development theme, I moved the upsell carousel so that you have to scroll below the cart line items to view it, and made a styling update to ensure the spacing matches what is currently on prod. With no other styling updates, it looks like this on mobile:

!IMG_3722.jpeg|width=216,alt=""IMG_3722.jpeg""!

Note that the “you may also like” heading part of the carousel is blending in with the subtotal part below it because the background colors are the same.



I could add spacing on mobile so this doesn’t happen, which looks like this:

!IMG_3723.jpeg|width=242,alt=""IMG_3723.jpeg""!

The components don’t blend together in this scenario, but the customer may not know that the upsell carousel is there since they have to scroll to it to see it. I’m wondering if this is the desired behavior? If we make this change, customers may not interact with this carousel as frequently.

The discrepancy between the “Express checkout” heading level in the WW, and CA checkout pages is due to the type of layout each store’s checkout is using.

WW uses the ‘Three-page’ layout option, which correctly sets the heading as an {{<h2>}}. CA uses the ‘One-page’ option that sets the heading as an {{<h3>}}. 

The code is black-boxed, so we cannot make any edits. However, we can fix the heading level for the CA site by switching that store’s checkout to use the Three-page layout option.",01/Oct/25 9:52 AM;712020:17f212a7-1f09-45be-8f0c-21dc916e4ba2;[~accountid:712020:e9372100-6dab-4faa-a739-63d35b1b9950] - assigning over to you for your thoughts.

I noticed that this error is causing some issues when duplicating the prod theme & doing development work for other tickets. Because there are errors associated with many of the JSON templates, when deploying to a dev theme there are often missing files such as {{collection.json}} (default collection template) and the default page template. The result is that pages like “All Insoles” (which uses the default collection template) and “Why Superfeet” (which uses the default page template) all result in a 404 error on the dev theme. This could slow down the development work on other tickets.

+*Notes:*+

# Until this is released, my recommendation would be to merge this branch into other feature branches being worked on this sprint or cherry pick the commit onto new feature branches to ensure that there aren’t issues with deploying to dev themes. 
## Note that prod is not currently impacted by this issue.
# QA will involve regression testing pages with an “image with text” component to confirm that the section still matches prod design/functionality

*Beginning of a potential solution, maybe:*

The ""no results found"" section is powered by Searchspring, outside of the reach of the Customizer, written in React, not in Shopify's Liquid. If we clear out the text and then create a Rich Text section below, within the ""No results boundary"", like this

[https://prnt.sc/FYi6XdBsiB2X|https://prnt.sc/FYi6XdBsiB2X|smart-embed]

It gets the job done but leaves too much white space between the ""No results for ...."" heading and the text:

[https://prnt.sc/U7nrtwtIlSbN|https://prnt.sc/U7nrtwtIlSbN|smart-embed]

----","8/19/25, 4:00 PM (EST) - Eddie Gemayel: Yep agreed with what Valerie said - Currently the area is editable but only in text field format. A metaobject with rich text options would probably be best if you want more semantic control over the text.",,,,,,,1|i05ktr:y59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"04/Aug/25 9:51 AM;62603c9a436629006f73bfee;[~accountid:5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c] Right now, the no results page is using a resource string stored in the window object. 

searchspring/superfeet/src/components/Header/Header.js - line 71 {{window.Resources.searchspring.results.noResultsCallToAction}}

This references sites/_shared/snippets/cql-head-content.liquid line 67 - {{noResultsCallToAction}} which references {{general.searchspring.results.no_results_cta}} in {{sites/_shared/locales/en.default.json}}. 



If the client knows how this text should be changed/formatted we can go ahead and make that change by updating the resource string and associated styling. That would probably be the easiest way since as you mentioned, the Searchspring content comes from React and isn’t accessible via Liquid. Would this work well? It would be a small change for sure, not much dev effort required (1-2 hrs).

The client could update the verbiage as desired there, and for CA we could have a metafield for EN and a metafield for FR. Then we should be able to read the value in {{cql-head-content}} and add it to the window.Resources object, and from there use the value in React. Assuming that this approach works well, I’d estimate this at about 4h of effort since we’ll need to set it up and verify for all 3 sites.",19/Aug/25 4:00 PM;625562406b000700696f509f;Yep agreed with what Valerie said - Currently the area is editable but only in text field format.

## There are still a couple messages around compressing images; will hold off for now since this could potentially impact image quality.","20/Aug/25 4:23 PM;625562406b000700696f509f;Thanks [~accountid:62603c9a436629006f73bfee] !

# *Timing:* The timing to show the popup is currently only {{1sec}}, where the standard range should be {{5-10sec}}. Increasing that time would very likely have a positive impact on the LCP. I would recommend starting with a delay time of {{8sec}}, to ensure the page has first been able to render what it needs to.
# *Scroll:* There is an option to delay the popup until the user has scrolled a certain percentage of the page. This will vary, as the length of page itself will vary, but {{30%}} is a standard, and the default setting in Klaviyo.

Options #1-3 are simple, and can be adjusted by anyone with admin access to the forms.

----

At the moment, it’s extremely challenging — and not reliable — to use GA4 data to answer the question of New vs. Returning Purchasers, due to how user identity is currently being tracked.

We had previously parked this due to competing priorities and the lack of a good testing environment.

Here is a summary of where things stand and what I recommend as the next steps to support accurate reporting on New vs. Returning Purchasers via GA4, in addition to Shopify.

----

*Current Situation*

* Shopify already tracks *New vs. Returning Purchasers* based on email address. While this is generally accurate, some customers may use new emails to game discount codes (e.g., “Welcome10”).

* GA4 could complement Shopify’s view — but only if the {{user_id}} *setup is correct*.

* Right now, Elevar is configured to push a {{user_id}} on all sessions (their default implementation), even when users aren’t logged in.

----

*What I Recommend*

* To fix this, we need to update the GA4 setup so that:

* {{user_id }}is only sent when a true Shopify Customer ID is available — and this value becomes available in the dataLayer once the user returns from the Shopify-hosted account page to the main storefront, and it then persists across logged-in pages.

* Anonymous users will be tracked by device (Client ID) only - which is how GA4 should handle unknown users.

This change aligns GA4 with Shopify’s logic, reduces identity errors, and enables cleaner segmentation and reporting in GA4 in this area.

*This fix* *_will work_* *if:*

* {{{{dlv - user_properties.customer_id}}}} (or equivalent) is:

* Present on the Thank You Page and becomes available on the storefront after the user returns from the Shopify-hosted Account Page (after logging in or making a purchase)

* Empty or undefined for anonymous sessions elsewhere

* The GA4 tags (config + event) are updated to use the conditional JS variable (example - DEV team / CQL needs to verify this, come up with best solution/implementation)

{noformat}function() {
  var customerId = {{dlv - Thank You Page - Customer ID}};
  return customerId && customerId !== """" ? customerId : undefined;
}{noformat}

* Correctly tested on staging (preferred) or in *GTM Preview + GA4 DebugView* (second option)

When those conditions are in place, this fix:

* *Prevents polluted* {{user_id}} *data*

* Ensures GA4 only receives identity signals when Shopify knows the customer (and only if Elevar hasn’t overridden {{user_id}} logic elsewhere).

* Allows GA4 to blend anonymous and identified sessions correctly

The dataLayer variable {{customer_id}} must remain consistent across the session after login - which current behavior confirms.

----

*Why This Matters*

With the corrected setup, we can:

* More accurately distinguish between *new and returning users/purchasers* in GA4

* Improve reliability of user-based reporting (funnels, LTV, cohorts)

* Use GA4 for behavioral trends and Shopify for transaction-validated customer identity

----

*Next Steps*

* Discuss with DEV team (CQL?) whether the above is feasible to implement

* If so, proceed to:

* Implement the conditional {{user_id}} logic in GTM

* QA on staging (preferred), or use GTM Preview + GA4 DebugView if staging is unavailable (e.g., John Tucker can test purchases on production and monitor values)

* Monitor the impact in GA4 reporting once live to ensure clean user segmentation and identity behavior

----

*Two Additional Notes*

* *Getting this right will improve all client projects using Elevar*, where identity tracking is often over-applied by default.

* I’ve implemented this approach on Salesforce-powered sites with dev teams — it has consistently unlocked deeper user insights and enabled *cross-device remarketing* based on verified customer behavior.",,Andrej Ciho,John Tucker,Pete Buzzell,Ryan Kroening,,,,,,,5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c,712020:f7042368-c53c-4a2e-b8f7-83d0cd38f1fa,712020:e9372100-6dab-4faa-a739-63d35b1b9950,712020:17f212a7-1f09-45be-8f0c-21dc916e4ba2,,,,,,,21600,20700,900,4%,21600,20700,900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Superfeet: Support,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@538e87b6,,,,,,0.0,,,,{},,,,,,,"h4. _Please follow the following format when adding issues_

While we could adjust the value of the user_id parameter as it is used across the site, the purchase event would not have a common user_id value, so the purchase event would would become completely disjointed from the rest of the session. 

Until we begin to explore custom purchase webhooks (which would require a new server side GTM Container/ configuration beyond Elevar), we’re stuck with Elevar’s definition of “user_id” and rule for when it is populated.

Homepage Findings:

# CLS sometimes flagged because of email signup popup - could this be delayed or set to appear once the user interacts with the page?
# Render blocking requests - We can look into deferring the Adobe Typekit resources; it looks like the recommendation is pointing to {{https://use.typekit.net/pqq1zqj.css}} which is used by theme.insole-finder.liquid. The rest are 1st party resources that shouldn't be inlined.
# Forced reflow is due to carousels adjusting to the correct height; will not change
# Network dependency tree; the assets are needed here to render the page correctly
# Use efficient cache lifetimes; the recommendation is referencing 3rd party code that we wouldn't be able to update.
# Improve image delivery; there is one image this is referencing that we could update, but it would only save 11 KiB. 
# Duplicated JS; this is 3rd party code we wouldn't be able to adjust.
# Legacy JS;  this is 3rd party code we wouldn't be able to adjust.
# Defer offscreen images; refers to the giving back powering movement image. We may be able to adjust this for about 104 KiB in savings.

*Validation of the found issue:*

There is a mismatch between the results count in the page title and the actual number of products returned on a Search page. Page title results count should match actual results on a search page.

Superfeet currently has separate product detail pages (PDPs) for insoles with different arch heights: low, medium, and high. Each has identical size variants but is merchandised as a separate product. This creates friction for customers comparing options and results in redundant product content. The goal is to create a unified PDP where customers can select *Arch Height* and *Shoe Size* as variant options from a single listing.

*User Story*

*As a* customer shopping for Superfeet insoles,

*I want* to see all arch height options (low, medium, high) for a product on one PDP,

*So that* I can easily compare and select the best fit for my needs without navigating multiple pages.

h3. *Acceptance Criteria*

# *PDP Variant Structure*
#* Combined listing shows two selectors: *Arch Height* (Low / Medium / High) and *Shoe Size* (e.g., M 7.5–9, W 8.5–10).
#* Selecting a combination updates the product image, price, and availability accordingly.
# *Backend Data & App Functionality*
#* Merchandisers can group individual arch height SKUs into a single listing using the Combined Listings app.
#* Each arch height remains a separate SKU in the backend for inventory and reporting purposes.
#* Product content (title, description, images) can vary per arch height but be presented within the same PDP.
# *Cart & Order Behavior*
#* Selected arch height and shoe size are shown in the cart and on the order confirmation.
#* Inventory is pulled from the correct underlying SKU based on selection.

Should the various arch heights remain shown as separate cards or also combined into a single card per product? The reason I ask is because my initial thinking with this ticket was to restructure the product data so that products are natively variated by both arch height and size, instead of adding the Combined Listings app.

There is another approach that we’ve implemented for some of our clients that we internally call “related styles”. You can see it on [this Rudis PDP|https://www.rudis.com/products/rudis-journey-knit-adult-training-shoes-black-red]. The color selector takes you to different PDPs but still gives the customer a clear understanding of what’s available. This approach is the “gentlest” with regards to overriding native Shopify functionality (and also with regards to budget). The one improvement I would want us to add if we were to go this route is to make sure the size selection stays the same as the user changes the arch height - like it would be on a native PDP.","21/Jul/25 10:05 AM;712020:e9372100-6dab-4faa-a739-63d35b1b9950;Thanks for sharing the Rudis example [~accountid:5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c]. Is that something we could split test to help us determine how consumers respond to this kind of merchandising change? 

I’m in favor of a product data change to natively support variated arch height & size, instead of the combined listings or “related styles” approach but I’d like to prove that this is a better way to shop through a “gentle” approach, if possible. If not possible, let’s explore how we could phase this in over time across the product set so we can measure impact to sales.","23/Jul/25 11:35 AM;5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c;[~accountid:712020:e9372100-6dab-4faa-a739-63d35b1b9950] Could you please speak to what is the desired experience for PLPs?

*As a* customer,

*I want* to be able to pre-order select new Superfeet products before they are in stock,

*So that* I can secure my purchase early and receive the product as soon as it becomes available.

h3. *Acceptance Criteria*

# *Admin Control*
## Merchandisers can enable/disable pre-order on a per-product basis via the Shopify admin or an integrated app.
## Pre-order status can be configured with a custom message and expected ship date.
# *Front-End Display*
## If a product is enabled for pre-order, the product page displays a “Pre-Order” button instead of “Add to Cart.”
## A label or badge indicating “Pre-Order” is shown on the PDP and in the cart.
## Estimated shipping date or availability date is shown clearly to the customer.
# *Checkout & Cart*
## Pre-order products are allowed in the cart, individually or mixed with in-stock products.
## Pre-order items are clearly labeled in the cart and during checkout.
# *Post-Purchase*
## Order confirmation and post-purchase emails clearly indicate which items are pre-orders.
## Pre-order products are tagged appropriately in the Shopify order for operational tracking.

h3. Assumptions

# Other than the messaging on the site and the line-item property on the order marking the item as a pre-order for downstream systems, it’s just a regular Shopify order.
# Products will ship before the authorization window expires.
# For each variant, the pre-order items will have ""Continue selling when out of stock"" enabled (if inventory = 0) or set sufficient inventory amount. Otherwise the item will appear as out of stock.
# The [Essential Preorder|https://apps.shopify.com/essential-pre-order] app is used
# The solution should be ready for roll-out across all 3 stores, including support for {{fr-ca}}.

h3. *Known Dev Changes Needed*

# The [Essential Preorder|https://apps.shopify.com/essential-pre-order] app ignores our custom logic on the PDP that disables the CTA until the user selects a size. We need a way to make it follow our logic.
# Acceptance criterium 2.b
## Design needed (lets estimate 2 hours)
## Since the Pre-Order CTA won’t be visible until the user select the size we need to indicate to the user that the item is a pre-order",,Andrej Ciho,Andrey Teslya,Eddie Gemayel,Nolan Soule,Pete Buzzell,Ryan Kroening,Scott Forden,Valerie Vos,,,5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c,712020:ea7cf33e-9a6e-4484-a43b-22f438631eb1,625562406b000700696f509f,63515c5259c794184bc8e4dc,712020:e9372100-6dab-4faa-a739-63d35b1b9950,712020:17f212a7-1f09-45be-8f0c-21dc916e4ba2,641b11d357f0c028e2f647ed,62603c9a436629006f73bfee,,,36000,0,39600,110%,36000,0,39600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,09/Sep/25 10:17 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;ATC-disabled-issue.mp4;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/78287,18/Aug/25 3:45 PM;ug:3440058c-e59b-4c48-9918-5842f102faac;Screenshot 2025-08-18 at 3.39.55 PM.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77115,29/Jul/25 12:32 PM;andrej.ciho;image-20250729-160604.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/76047,29/Jul/25 12:32 PM;andrej.ciho;image-20250729-160739.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/76048,29/Jul/25 12:32 PM;andrej.ciho;image-20250729-160854.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/76046,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145211.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77728,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145226.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77727,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145357.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77731,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145433.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77726,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145507.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77733,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145556.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77735,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145628.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77729,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-145929.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77732,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-150003.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77725,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250828-150109.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77734,09/Sep/25 10:17 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;image-20250909-141035.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/78288,11/Sep/25 6:02 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;multi-variation-issue-fixed.mp4;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/78427,28/Aug/25 11:08 AM;6bf8dd29-943a-4502-8e7d-7f478152ba2e;variation-selection-issues.mp4;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/77730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Superfeet: Support,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@a0aa99,,,,,,0.0,,,"Theme Preview:

# I duplicated an existing product on the staging store to create a test product for this ticket called “Run Pacer Elite”. This product is set to “Active” on the staging store.
## [https://superfeet-staging.myshopify.com/products/run-pacer-elite|https://superfeet-staging.myshopify.com/products/run-pacer-elite] 
# I re-indexed the products in SearchSpring so that the new product “Run Pacer Elite” appears on collection pages.
# I created a campaign in the Essential Preorder app specifically associated with the test product called {{Run Pacer Elite - TEST}}. 
# Note - to see pre-order functionality, the Essential Preorder app needs to be activated/enabled on the theme. Added that as a separate commit on {{feature/SUPS25-128-preorder}}



Current UI (dev):

The preorder button displays in the UI for the test product. The next step will be adding conditional logic as described in the ticket AC to ensure that the CTA is disabled until the customer chooses a size/variant. 

If there is a way this can be done within the app that may be the best approach, otherwise we may have to look into adding a custom script that looks for the preorder button by class name ({{essential-preorder-add-to-cart-button-default}}) and then enables/disables it based on whether a size/variant is selected. Note that the preorder button is injected directly; there are no placeholder containers or code snippets that we’ve added on our side for this functionality.","19/Aug/25 11:23 AM;62603c9a436629006f73bfee;+*Notes regarding acceptance criteria:*+

The core web vitals in PSI pull from prod and not the Shopify preview theme, but if you scroll down to the full performance report it should have metrics for the preview theme. That being said, PSI has built-in throttling that can’t be disabled which decreases all of the scores. You could potentially use the Lighthouse CLI to test this without throttling if you’d like. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks so much!",15/Jul/25 1:34 PM;62603e3facc905006881cb25;[~accountid:62603c9a436629006f73bfee] Thank you! I modified my previous comment with the CLI outputs and noticed UK mobile has a FCP value of 2.4. Could you look into this please?,"15/Jul/25 1:58 PM;62603c9a436629006f73bfee;[~accountid:62603e3facc905006881cb25] Thanks! I ran a couple tests locally for UK and FCP was 1.1s on mobile and 0.8s on desktop, if you want to test it again you could try running the lighthouse CLI on the preview theme URL a few times to get an average. I’ve had cases where running it 2-3 times has helped confirm the correct value. We will also likely see a boost in performance metrics once all of the performance code changes are published, so if you’re still seeing 2.4 I think there’s a chance when it’s published it shows as below 1.8.

Between these three site components, I was only able to safely remove one extra div/node. The design patterns for these site components look good to me - there may be a spare div here and there, but removing these alone wouldn’t be enough to make a significant impact on site performance. 

The Superfeet homepage currently has 1727 nodes on mobile, and 2112 nodes on desktop. To get down to a warning for DOM size, we would need to remove over 700 elements/nodes to get below the 1400 threshold. To completely resolve the DOM size issue, we would need to remove over 1300 elements/nodes to get below the 800 threshold. I don’t think we would be able to accomplish this through refactoring each section and snippet alone (which may also introduce regression concerns) - it would likely require a loss of functionality to greatly simplify all of the code that renders on key pages. 

I discussed these findings with [~accountid:625562406b000700696f509f] as well, and we are thinking that it makes more sense to close this ticket along with the corresponding PLP and PDP tickets as “Won’t Do”:

[https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/browse/SUPS25-130|https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/browse/SUPS25-130|smart-link] 

[https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/browse/SUPS25-131|https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/browse/SUPS25-131|smart-link] 

That way we can use hours towards other performance efforts instead.

# For third-party JS/CSS files, we unfortunately can’t split out or remove unused code since we don’t have that level of control (i.e. code is not in our repo). The best we can do is optimize code within our repo, and then make sure that all of the third-party code/apps are still used.","01/Jul/25 4:20 PM;625562406b000700696f509f;[~accountid:62603c9a436629006f73bfee] Thank you for this!

*Validation of the issue found:*

* When adding a video component to the image with text module, the video image does not appear as expected on desktop (image overlapping at bottom) and we are unable to change the video playback button (desktop and mobile) to a different color even though a hex code color is applied under media options. Need to correct.

# Lighthouse CLI reports are beneficial because throttling can be disabled manually, which isn’t currently possible with PageSpeed Insights. This is why PageSpeed Insights reports have lower scores. The Lighthouse CLI doesn’t work with our standard Shopify theme preview links, but does work with a link that is generated via the bar at the bottom of the theme preview page. Example: [https://q07aftfg4xv2j83u-63853461687.shopifypreview.com|https://q07aftfg4xv2j83u-63853461687.shopifypreview.com] 
# One thing to keep in mind - I've noticed that sometimes when running the performance audits/reports, Lighthouse will sometimes pick up a cumulative layout shift issue with the Klaviyo marketing pop-up, or will accidentally flag the Klaviyo marketing pop-up as the LCP which brings the performance score down. It doesn't happen every time the tool runs, just kind of an intermittent issue. The client will likely want to keep their marketing pop-ups as is - just something to be aware of when looking into performance metrics. I checked and the Klaviyo app doesn’t have any settings we can configure for this unfortunately.
# When the performance code changes are published, we will likely see a small increase in scores as well since Shopify preview themes/links tend to redirect and slow down Lighthouse/PSI a bit. 
# Lighthouse CLI isn’t always consistent; can try running the same command a few times to generate a few reports to help confirm whether the scores are accurate.
# Example Lighthouse CLI commands:
## Mobile: {{lighthouse https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all --throttling-method=provided --view}}
## Desktop: {{lighthouse https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all  --throttling-method=provided --view --preset=desktop}}



[~accountid:5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c] Could you please review these findings? Based on what I’m seeing in the reports, it looks like we have optimized performance for about as much as we can from our side. The diagnostics in the reports are now pointing primarily to third-party resources loading. We are also not planning on creating critical CSS/JS files since these can make the code base harder to read and maintain, and we are not planning on reducing DOM size.

Set up in Shopify appears that I can only select one SS instance for this recommendation block. SS instance CA-EN is selected. There isn’t an option to select both CA-EN and CA-FR.

For french Recommendations, you need to create a new section with the {{CA-FR}} option enabled, and with a Profile Id from the {{ca-fr}} Searchspring admin.

The sections have logic to dynamically hide on opposing languages. So in total, you would have 2 Searchspring recommendation sections there in the customizer; one english and one french. Let me know if that makes sense.

If you would like to have it consolidated to 1 section, we can get a new estimate for you with the right approach. 🙂  [~accountid:712020:0edf201d-da9c-430f-9d5a-4940492e06da] ",09/Jul/25 1:25 PM;712020:17f212a7-1f09-45be-8f0c-21dc916e4ba2;[~accountid:712020:0edf201d-da9c-430f-9d5a-4940492e06da] - pinging to be sure you saw Eddie’s latest comment.

For reference I’ve been using the product All-Purpose Support High Arch for dev, which uses the template {{apma-approved}}. I’ve set the new product metafield (custom.hsa_fsa_eligible) to true for this product and have been updating the {{apma-approved}} template to test out new functionality. I have a few questions before continuing with development:

# Could we please get asset files for the two icons (black checkmark in circle & green checkmark in circle)? 
# If the product already has a badge at the top left (e.g. Best Seller) should the HSA/FSA badge still display at the top right as well? Or should only one badge display at a time (i.e. should the HSA/FSA badge replace the Best Seller badge or would the Best Seller badge take priority?)
# For the inline icons - I’m assuming this new HSA/FSA icon should only display on the page if the product has the new HSA/FSA eligibility metafield set to true, correct?
# For the new section (HSA/FSA Eligible - in most cases you can use HSA/FSA dollars for Superfeet insoles…):
## Does the client want to be able to adjust the height, background color, and text color within this section?
## Where would the “Click to learn more” link take the customer? Is there an HSA/FSA content page that has already been created? I assume this would be the same link used for the tooltip as well for the inline icon.
## Should this section display on the page even if the particular product on the PDP isn’t eligible for HSA/FSA? Or should it only show if it’s been added in the customizer and the particular product has the metafield set to true?
# Does this feature apply to US, CA, and UK or just US?
# Does this feature apply across all product templates? Or is there a chance that a specific product template will be created for products that are HSA/FSA eligible?

# For the new section (HSA/FSA Eligible - in most cases you can use HSA/FSA dollars for Superfeet insoles…): {color:#ff5630}I should clarify the ask here as I don’t think I did that well originally. We are looking for a flexible content block underneath the inline icons as an additional messaging option. The idea is that this additional content block could allow for different text treatments such as text only, image with text, banner etc. Idea is to have an optional visual element underneath the inline icons that stands out and has the ability to have a pop up with additional info upon hover or click or that can be linked directly to another landing page.

## Use the theme preview URL and make sure to click “use original URL” so that it uses the preview theme ID parameter as part of the URL. 
### Note: Core Web Vitals at the top of the report are pulled from prod so this value will still show as failing. Scroll down to the performance report to see a more accurate data point for cumulative layout shift under “Metrics” which shows that CLS has been reduced successfully.
# Please regression test PLPs to ensure that adding the skeleton loader does not cause any unexpected behavior. 
## If you need a way to see the skeleton loader more easily, right click to inspect the page and open DevTools. Go to the “Network” tab, and change throttling to something like 4G or 3G so that the page loads more slowly.",{},,,,,,,"h4. _Please follow the following format when adding issues_

*Testing scenario:*

# Can test with a tool like [https://pagespeed.web.dev/|https://pagespeed.web.dev/|smart-link]  to confirm that the CLS issue has been resolved for mobile and desktop views.
## Use the theme preview URL and make sure to click “use original URL” so that it uses the preview theme ID parameter as part of the URL.
### Note: Core Web Vitals at the top of the report are pulled from prod so this value will still show as failing. Scroll down to the performance report to see a more accurate data point for cumulative layout shift under “Metrics” which shows that CLS has been reduced successfully.

# Please regression test PLPs to ensure that adding the skeleton loader does not cause any unexpected behavior. (/) 
## If you need a way to see the skeleton loader more easily, right click to inspect the page and open DevTools. Go to the “Network” tab, and change throttling to something like 4G or 3G so that the page loads more slowly.

Ability to have more than one FAQ section per page, each showing a different FAQ group of questions.

*Current Implementation*

On the FAQ page, the {{Accordion - Automated}} section in the Customizer has a {{referenced_metafield}} property that currently stores the value 'faq_group'. This value identifies which meta object the section should utilize.

Then the FAQ page itself has a page metafield called {{FAQ Group}} which currently stores a value ‘FAQs’ - this is a specific group of questions meant for the FAQ page. Because of this architecture, only one FAQ section can be shown per page.

File:
info-accordion-automated.liquid

*Note*: the code doesn't specify “page”-specific metafield, but object-specific metafield, so it could be on a product or perhaps collection as well.

*Recommended change*

# The section could have a new setting allowing Tonya to identify the specific FAQ Group to be used with the section. (That way she can insert multiple instances of this section, each showing a different FAQ group)
# If this is empty, then the info-accordion-automated.liquid should continue to use the object-level metafield.

I think the best way to do this would be to actually just remove the metafield reference that points to the FAQ Group and just allow direct metaobject references, i.e {{{{ shop.metaobjects.faq_group.qr-code-pages-insole-fa-qs.name }}}}.

This is because the metafield reference only allows 1 metaobject at a time, not a list of metaobjects.

We can add a text field setting to allow someone to specify the exact faq group they want. Trying to write this all out so i don’t forget later, hopefully that makes sense 🙂

Notes:

# Main logic change is in the Liquid file to switch approaches to reference the metaobject entry handle from the customizer. 
# Updated all instances of {{info-accordion-automated}}. I noticed that in many instances of this component, the component did not appear on the page even if it was set up in the customizer because of the previous logic in place checking for some sort of match. So I updated all instances to match existing prod behavior. If there was a valid FAQ Group appearing on the page, then I updated the setting to reference the correct metaobject entry handle. But if there wasn't a valid FAQ group appearing on the page, I went ahead and removed the instance of that {{info-accordion-automated}} to avoid confusion. This way all the existing {{info-accordion-automated}} instances are all using the new setting only, and match what exists on prod. If the client wants to add more instances of this component across all three sites they are welcome to :)","19/Aug/25 4:45 PM;625562406b000700696f509f;[~accountid:62603c9a436629006f73bfee] Works great, just left a note on the PR for merge conflict resolution 🙂

It would be great to hear your thoughts on the Unassigned traffic spikes as I haven't seem this before at the session-level in GA4:

* Often this issue is caused by either UTM issues OR a missing 'session_start' event due to the technical implementation.
** Both don't seem the case here based on pattern and deeper investigation.
* Also, it comes with periodical influxes on 'unassigned' and is not stable throughout the weeks/months.
* The traffic performs (converts) well / above average. It greatly impacts the channel-analysis though especially when looking at a few days of data.
* A granular look at the data also shows a relatively, normalized distribution across all landing pages.

!image-20250317-141255.png|width=1436,height=646,alt=""image-20250317-141255.png""!

* The 'session_start' event is only missing in a couple of cases (data 10 - 11 March) -> this is +*not*+ the cause of the issue.

* The last column shows there is quite a normalized distribution across landing pages when comparing the landing page and _factor_ (dividing first value by second value) of non-unassigned vs unassigned sessions.

This _very_ low percentage of Unassigned (connected to the normal volume of Unassigned outside of these traffic spikes) looks also suspicious to me:

!image-20250317-141319.png|width=1920,height=1065,alt=""image-20250317-141319.png""!

Last note is that it is also reflected in the event-level attribution (data is processed more quickly compared to session-level data) so we can already review last weekend's channel data here:

*15 March, 2025*

!image-20250317-141330.png|width=1907,height=860,alt=""image-20250317-141330.png""!

*16 March, 2025*

!image-20250317-141337.png|width=1920,height=887,alt=""image-20250317-141337.png""!

Temporarily, we can equally redistribute (based on relative sessions/conversions) the traffic and conversions of Unassigned to the 'known' (NOT unassigned) channels. But this is just band aid and doesn't work long-term.

There are many different (technical) reasons why this could be the case, but partly blank for me, Elevar integration and some other unknowns here.

Do you have any comments on what we are seeing?

For full visibility, we are still having the SS team look into an issue, the time remaining could be much less or more depending on what they say. ","17/Jul/25 10:04 AM;625562406b000700696f509f;Searchspring team has confirmed the Recs are up for the US instance, but the intellisuggest data events are not showing up in the actual dashboard, which will make it difficult to validate via QA for us.

SS has suggested to publish the current changes on the next release, and with the inflow of real data, it will allow them to better debug why no data shows up in the dashboard. With this influx of real data, the SS team will also setup recs for the other stores.

I agree with their direction and think we should go this route. If there are any objections or questions let me know 🙏

I will reach back out to Chris from SS and confirm that the other instances can get setup with dynamic blog recs now too.

The {{sandbox}} store is the exception, but I think this is fine and we can workaround it.

Acceptance Criteria

Once Superfeet provides CQL the new logo, fonts and colors, CQL will:

# Update these globally in a preview theme.
# Review the website and make adjustments to any section found to have been negatively impacted by the global change. Areas reviewed on both desktop and mobile will include
## Header + Navigation
## Footer
## PLP
## PDP
## Section visible on home page, work landing page, PLP and PDP
# Provide Superfeet a preview link on the production store
## This will exclude logo updates and in email notifications because those can only be changed store-wide, not in a preview. If needed, these can be updated in the staging store for review.

h2. Notes

# Superfeet plans to provide the new branding artifacts by April 11th

Thanks to the team for the global styling work – we saw the link to the preview themes come through and will review tomorrow.

Forgot to mention - We would like a drop shadow added so the expanded nav is elevated off of the page content. This does not need to be complete 5/6, we are flexible on that add.

h2. Original Request

SF team has asked for additional styling options of the testimonial text in the information carousel component in the customizer. We are starting to utilize this module on plp’s and there has been quite a bit of feedback that the existing styling is very hard to read. Request has been made to eliminate the bold and leading caps of the paragraph text and have it show up as entered in the testimonial component. 

Example: 

Text entered as not bold and lower case in testimonial field but appears bold and leading caps in content. 

I also took a screen cast that shows we can utilize the headline types in the module but a large extra space is put in between the leading quote and the text and I would want to make sure the appropriate styling with font etc is used.

+*Note:*+

Changing the element used in rich text won’t change the styling of the testimonial text, but it will change the element used (i.e. h1, h2, h3, p, etc.) This is because this selection is more for SEO than for styling. If the info carousel is used in a place where it makes sense to use a heading tag, that option is available. But in this particular case on the home page, it seems like a paragraph tag would be the best choice.

# Embedded YouTube videos should span the entire with of blog post but not “spill over”

*Technical Implementation*

# Via CSS, automatically apply 100% width & auto-height to any {{<iframe>}} inside {{.article-template}}

*Original Description*

When adding a youtube embed to to Shopify blog posts, the iframe is not responsive. The result is a youtube video embed that is way too wide for the page, causing unexpected horizontal scroll, or too narrow for the page, resulting in a poor visual experience.

Ideal state is to make iframe embeds on blog posts responsive. I was able to achieve this on a single blog post by adding a style block to set iframe width to 100% of it’s container width - [https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/technology/how-3d-printed-me3d-personalized-insoles-are-made|https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/technology/how-3d-printed-me3d-personalized-insoles-are-made|smart-link] ",,Andrej Ciho,Dustin Milam,Eddie Gemayel,Mark Hendriks,Matt Pokornicki,Ryan Kroening,,,,,5a8addd80cf0b230313b571c,712020:77ba3c7b-7a98-405b-b586-be5918836a47,625562406b000700696f509f,712020:2d312cfb-be3c-4c57-a930-80f86e52848e,62603e3facc905006881cb25,712020:17f212a7-1f09-45be-8f0c-21dc916e4ba2,,,,,7200,0,9000,125%,7200,0,9000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21/Jan/25 2:13 PM;712020:77ba3c7b-7a98-405b-b586-be5918836a47;Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 1.39.03 PM.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/61229,21/Jan/25 2:13 PM;712020:77ba3c7b-7a98-405b-b586-be5918836a47;Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2.02.22 PM.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/61230,21/Jan/25 2:13 PM;712020:77ba3c7b-7a98-405b-b586-be5918836a47;Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2.02.54 PM.png;https://cqlcorp.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/61228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Superfeet: Support,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@d504127,,,,,,0.0,,,"Example blog posts:

When on the a blog page with a video, the video container spans the length of the blog post without spilling over

None of the Vimeo embeds have either a width or height, resulting in a default aspect ratio that adds extra space on the sides.

You can see the extra space that is just part of the iframe:

!Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 1.39.03 PM.png|width=1681,height=674,alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 1.39.03 PM.png""!



Since the wrapper I put around the iframe preserves its aspect ratio, it retains the spacing around it:

!Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2.02.22 PM.png|width=1675,height=687,alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 2.02.22 PM.png""!

But if I force it to retain an aspect ratio as though it was width=""640"" height=""360"" (as it defaults to from the embed link) it looks correct. So the question is should it just have that static aspect ratio instead of basing it on the iframe’s height/width?

After some investigation, the issue here is that there is a {{bold}} style being inherited for this section’s heading. The Kerning value is correct.

We can update the CSS to remove the extra {{bold}} applying to this section’s header.

Approved, I can see everything looks good in the code and the PDP.

However as Dustin pointed out, we won’t be able to properly QA and Client QA the PLP this until a sale comes up, so searchspring can be indexed. Going to put this as Hold for now.

I do not know the best way to test the PLP & autocomplete; I had to force a fake sale price to display in order to style it. Even if we temporality publish the test product, we’d have to wait for SS to index it to show on the PLP and will probably leave it visible for too long.

# It would be beneficial to have a staging store where we could test things like this ticket so that we don’t accidentally have a user purchase a discounted product.
# CQL could estimate setting up a staging store. Would need to determine how “complete” the store should be. The first thing that comes to mind is Searchspring. The staging store would need a dedicated index for the product data and another one for the blog data if we’re really looking for a full-fledged staging store experience.
# Setting up the staging store would include
## Creating metafield and metaobject definitions for all content types (product, variant, collection, page, blog post….)
## Importing data (products, variants, collections, pages, blog posts)
## Setting up and configuring Searchspring indices (products, blogs)
## Adding staging store to the deploy process and deploying latest theme code",20/Jan/25 1:37 PM;712020:2d312cfb-be3c-4c57-a930-80f86e52848e;Additional cost for SearchSpring: $150 per index per month (need 2 indices: Blog and Products) → $300 per month,"21/Jan/25 5:39 PM;625562406b000700696f509f;Estimate added.

Correct. We would like to be able to align this disclaimer text box independently of the other blocks in the image banner.","10/Jan/25 7:32 AM;62603e3facc905006881cb25;Tested on {{[SUPS-60]}} Shopify theme.

The disclaimer block can be added to an image banner component and can shift the location of the disclaimer matching with the three positions in the screenshot. There is a separate option for control on mobile as well.

[~accountid:62603e3facc905006881cb25] I fixed the issue on the “Shop by category” slider. Current theme: [https://www.superfeet.com/pages/holiday-gift-guide?preview_theme_id=174330577263|https://www.superfeet.com/pages/holiday-gift-guide?preview_theme_id=174330577263|smart-link] 

For the other, SearchSpring powered sliders, the issue appears to be that because it set to loop, so a little of the next slide shows because you technically can keep clicking “next slider. 

My actually question: What attributes are important to preserve for certain aspects of the slider? Would it be alright, for example, to disable looping on tablet & smaller, or other things that may possibly affect this overflow? (showing 4 slides instead of 4, moving by 1 card at a time instead of 4)

Best place to test this is the Holiday gift guide, link in the ticket. But, can be tested anywhere with a Searchspring carousel.

I noticed one thing when I was looking at this - let me know if you feel like it should be a separate ticket or if you feel like it could be handled as part of this one.

So when you hover over a Searchspring product card in the carousel, a border appears around the entire card. Because the swiper carousel has a 100% width and 100% height, it looks like that border sometimes gets cut off:

!SUPS25-25-Border-1.png|width=1160,height=885,alt=""SUPS25-25-Border-1.png""!

I was able to resolve it by adding {{margin: 1px;}} to the {{.swiper-wrapper}} so there is enough room for the border. Maybe there’s another approach that would be better but that was just my first idea:

This is called out on the announcement bar global element. The carousel script that rotates through the content elements in the announcement bar are being updated by the script to use aria-hidden=”true”. 

The issue with this approach is that the block-section-announcement-x divs contain focusable content like links and paragraph text, but because they’re marked with aria-hidden='true', screen readers and accessibility tech will still try to read and focus on this hidden content.

Suggested approach:

* Replace aria-hidden=”true” with tabIndex={-1} to prevent focus on hidden elements in the carousel.
* Improve semantic markup by adding role=”region”, aria-roledescription=”carousel”, and aria-label=”announcement carousel” or something to that effect.

Per Powermapper:
_Add visible text to the heading, or_ {{alt}} _text if the heading contains an image. Screen readers read out page headings, allowing users to quickly skip to a section, but some older screen readers do not ignore empty headings._

In this case, we would like to prevent heading tags from being included in the markup if the field in the content component is blank without impacting the text spacing on the front-end.

Issue is present when cart is empty. As a keyboard navigation user, I’m able to open the empty mini cart but the CTA “Continue Shopping” is not a focusable element and I’m not able to interact with it. That CTA is also missing an ARIA role attribute

Please add tabindex=0 and role=link attributes to this continue shopping CTA to bring it back into compliance.

Detail from Powermapper:

Clickable controls should be keyboard accessible.

{noformat}<a onclick='this.closest(&#39;car...' class=' button  button--...'>Continue shopping</a>{noformat}

Add {{tabindex=0}} to allow keyboard users to tab to the control.

----

Clickable controls should have an ARIA role.

{noformat}<a onclick='this.closest(&#39;car...' class=' button  button--...'>Continue shopping</a>{noformat}

Controls that respond to clicks should be given an ARIA role such as {{role=button}} or {{role=link}}. {{divspan}} and {{a}} elements without an {{href}} attribute have no semantic role.

-I don’t have a screenshot of PLP because that would require having the product active long enough to allow Searchspring to index it.

It looks like of all these places, cart looks the best 🙂. In light of the screenshots, I suggest for this ticket we change the acceptance criteria to make the minicart display the same colors and information regarding the compare-at pricing as the cart.

I agree with your assessment and I’m aligned with your recommendation to make the strikethrough pricing display on mini-cart, PDP, PLP, and product recommendation/recently viewed tiles match the cart display.

I did figure out a few things I can do to help with this, but it would be great to have as an option as well. I found if I adjust the “desktop content area maximum size (px)” area, I can sometimes force a line break, but it would be great if there was another option to make it easier.
