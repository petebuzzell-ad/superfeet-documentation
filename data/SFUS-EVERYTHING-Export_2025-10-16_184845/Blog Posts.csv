But Run Pacer Elite isn’t just an insole, it’s an edge.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">WHAT MAKES RUN PACER ELITE DIFFERENT?</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At the core of Run Pacer Elite is our most advanced technology pairing yet: a Carbitex® carbon fiber plate and SuperRev™ foam. Together, the combined technologies unlock 39% more responsiveness, compared to traditional insoles or shoes alone, giving every runner the opportunity to feel fast on demand.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/rpe-blog-image1.webp?v=1759532731"" alt=""Green Superfeet Run Pacer Elite insole floating on black background"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Carbitex dynamically flexible carbon fiber plate is precision-calibrated to adapt with every pace. Unlike stiff, restrictive plates, Carbitex works <i>with</i> the body by engaging stiffness as it bends, providing geared power at higher speeds while remaining highly flexible at slower speeds, ensuring a natural ride at easy paces while unleashing explosive propulsion during faster speeds.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Complementing this propulsion is the all-new SuperRev foam, created via a supercritical process infusing advanced foams with high-pressure CO2 and nitrogen to create a unique microcellular structure. The result: maximum energy return, lightweight responsiveness, and durable comfort that cushions every landing while powering runners into their next stride.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">WHO IS RUN PACER ELITE FOR?</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Run Pacer Elite may be our most advanced insole, but you don’t need a sub-five-minute mile to reap the benefits of greater energy return and responsiveness. The unique flexibility of the Carbitex carbon fiber plate meets you at your pace and powers you through every stride, whether you’re training for your first 5K or running your tenth marathon. Of course, pros love what Run Pacer Elite can add to their workouts and races as well.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>FERNDALE, Wash.</b> — Superfeet, the global leader in performance insoles, is expanding its growing athlete roster by adding Colleen Quigley. Known for her dedication to sport and community, Quigley embodies the holistic athlete ethos at the heart of Superfeet.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Quigley – a 2016 Olympian in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, NCAA national champion, nine-time All-American and 2025 inductee in the Florida State University Athletics Hall of Fame – has built her career on passion, versatility and perseverance. From her unconventional beginnings as a dancer and model to becoming one of America’s top middle-distance runners, her journey proves it’s never too late to chase the sport’s highest stage through hard work and dedication. Today, she is both a competitor and a community leader, serving as a role model for modern athletes who view peak performance as part of a well-rounded lifestyle.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“This partnership is about more than sport,” says Trip Randall, CEO of Superfeet. “Colleen represents performance with perspective: she’s an Olympian, a mentor and an advocate for mental health and balance. Her story aligns perfectly with Superfeet’s mission: Designed for movement. Built to change lives.”</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Several factors contribute to this common workplace issue:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><strong><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Continuous Muscle Engagement and Fatigue</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><span lang=""EN-US"" data-contrast=""auto"">Unlike walking, where muscles get brief moments of rest between steps, standing keeps your foot and leg muscles constantly engaged to maintain balance and support. This continuous engagement leads to muscle fatigue and soreness throughout your shift.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><strong><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Poor Circulation and Blood Pooling</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Gravity constantly pulls blood downward, and when you stand for extended periods, blood can pool in your lower legs, ankles, and feet. This makes it difficult for your circulatory system to return blood to your heart efficiently, resulting in swelling, stiffness, and pain.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><strong><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Inadequate Footwear Support</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Your choice of work shoes plays a monumental role in foot health. Flat, rigid, or unsupportive footwear can significantly strain your feet. Shoes with narrow toe boxes pinch your toes, while lack of cushioning leads to pain in the forefoot and heel. Worn-out shoes also lose their ability to absorb shock, increasing your risk of various foot problems.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto""></span><strong><span lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""auto"">Poor Posture and Alignment</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"" data-contrast=""auto"">When fatigue sets in, many workers adopt suboptimal postures that create muscle imbalances and increased strain on certain foot areas. This ""swayback"" posture puts extra pressure on your feet and can exacerbate existing discomfort.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>

"997989581167","welcome-to-the-future-of-superfeet","MERGE","Welcome to the Future of Superfeet","Superfeet User","<p class=""MsoNormal"">The bold idea for Superfeet was sparked by listening to athletes searching for a competitive edge. Founded in 1977 by Dennis Brown and Dr. Chris Smith as part of the Sports Medicine Division of Northwest Podiatric Laboratory, the vision for this new venture was simple: to help athletes perform at their best.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It began with ski boot expanders for pro skiers. Then came custom cork insoles made on-site, transforming the way snow athletes carve and shred down the slopes. Soon, Superfeet were in hockey skates, work boots and, of course, running shoes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Over the next four decades, that simple but insightful idea from the lab grew into a global foot support phenomenon.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span>Powerful New Strides</span></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Today, Superfeet insoles are worn by the world’s top athletes, who trust the signature shape that mirrors the foot in motion to deliver power and performance where it counts. The anatomically engineered shape is backed up by industry leading materials like carbon fiber and supercritical ATPU foam, creating the ultimate supportive foundation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We’re proud of our legacy driving people across finish lines, up mountains, and down city streets. But we’re never satisfied with good enough. It’s time to be bold. To go all in. To bring our experience and expertise in sports performance to the forefront.</p>

"997879120239","innovation-in-action-upgrading-superfeet-run-support-insoles","MERGE","Innovation in Action: Upgrading Superfeet Run Support Insoles","Superfeet User","<p>Superfeet Run Support insoles empower athletes to train harder and reach their goals faster, whether at the elite level or gearing up to crush their first 5k. With more durable, weight-defying arch support infused with carbon fiber and enhanced foam cushioning, Run Support High, Medium and Low Arch insoles have been upgraded to a whole new level. Here’s a rundown (no pun intended) of all the best new features and how each enhancement helps deliver unmatched performance under every step.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Fit &amp; Feel</strong></p>
<p>Each insole in the Run Support line now features premium Aerospring™ foam, offering the same fatigue-fighting comfort for every arch height. The dual-layer design cushions ground impact and helps provide enhanced energy return as you move. Whether you’re looking for a high-arch shape or more neutral support, you’ll find the same advanced cushioning across each Run Support insole.</p>
<p><strong>Durable Rearfoot Support</strong></p>
<p>Superfeet are known for their durability, even after hundreds of miles of hard use. The new encapsulating heel cup and arch support shape are now even more robust, enabling you to push it to the limit and beyond. Made with EVOLyte® material, a carbon fiber and polymer blend, the lightweight and springy support works with the natural biomechanics of your foot. The small gel H.I.T. Pod that was present in some Run Support products has been removed to create a more cohesive, durable design. After extensive testing, the new stabilizer cap delivered the same performance and support with even greater longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative Materials</strong></p>
<p>Engineering insoles with the highest quality materials and latest advances in material science has always been a core part of Superfeet. Investing in research and innovation creates industry-leading products while also advancing our goals for a healthier planet. We’re proud to introduce Moisturewick™ top covers made from 100% recycled PET plastic to the Run Support Line. The new premium foams also incorporate recycled materials, and the more durable EVOLyte® stabilizer cap reduces overall waste.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"" dir=""ltr""><strong>Joanna Lohman: </strong><span> Happy National Girls and Women in Sport Day.  It means celebrating the progress that we have made in women's sports dating back to </span><a href=""https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/advocacy/what-is-title-ix/"" title=""https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/advocacy/what-is-title-ix/"" target=""_blank""><span>Title IX</span></a><span>, and it also means elevating access, opportunity, media, financial resources for female athletes all over the world and making sure that we're consistently breaking barriers day in and day out and letting everybody know that everyone watches women's sports. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(141, 198, 63);""><strong>Superfeet: How has sports shaped who you are today?</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Joanna Lohman:</strong> </span><span>Sport has been the number one factor in what has shaped me into the person I am today, because the field is a metaphor for life. So all the skills you learn on the field are resilience, courage, focus, determination, and teamwork. Picking yourself back up again when you fall are all aspects that I use every single day in my life now. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And I think sport has really taught me that when we lean into our unique impact, when we contribute the best to our role, that is when a team wins a championship and there is nothing more applicable to life than that. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span style=""color: rgb(141, 198, 63);""><strong>Superfeet: What advice would you give young girls pursuing their dreams in sports?</strong></span><span><br></span><span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Joanna Lohman:</strong><span> The advice that I would give to a young girl who is pursuing her dreams and playing sport is to absolutely fall in love with the game and the process. It is not about a certain amount of goals or assists or a medal or a tro</span><span>phy or a college scholarship. This is about you pursuing your own version of excellence, and you don't have to be the greatest to be great. So, lean into your unique value and contribution. Give it all you can to the team, and you will find greatness. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Estelle Johnson:</strong><span><strong> </strong>National Girls and Women and Sports Day means celebrating the power of sport to transform lives and empower women. As a professional athlete and a mom, it's about reflecting on my journey, supporting equity and inspiring the next generation to continue the work we've begun. Above all, it's about showing little girls that they belong in sports. Playing sports has shaped who I am by teaching me discipline, resilience in the value of teamwork.</span><span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Estelle Johnson:</strong><span> It's given me the confidence to overcome challenges, both on and off the field, and has shown me the importance of setting goals and pushing myself to achieve them. Sports have taught me to lead, to adapt and to trust the process, all of which have shaped how I navigate life as a mom and a role model. My advice to young girls pursuing their dreams in sports is to focus on the journey, not just the destination. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sports are about more than just the wins and losses there. A chance to build character, develop resilience, and learn the value of self-belief. Embrace the challenges because they'll teach you to stay determined. Celebrate the small victories because they'll show you your growth. And remember the lessons you learned will serve you far beyond the field or court. Keep dreaming big and use sports as a vehicle to shape you into the strong, confident person that you're meant to be. </span></p>

With the help of a local Fleet Feet store, Superfeet recently donated insoles to a high school cross country team in Menasha, Wisconsin. Here’s the story of how dedication and hard work, an inspiring coach, and proper support in footwear can lead to incredible results at the finish line and beyond.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>

</h3>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">After running track at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, Tony DeVine became a nationally licensed sprint coach. He was coaching at a nearby middle school when an opportunity came up to coach the Menasha High School cross country team. Tony jumped at the chance, even if it was difficult at first. He had to pitch students on the idea of joining cross country. Luckily, he’s a natural salesman. “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">If I wasn't a teacher, I'd probably be selling used cars someplace,</span><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">” he joked in an interview. He also recognized the value of representation, knowing there weren’t many Black cross country coaches. As he put it, “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">There's not a lot of people who look like me that are coaching cross country.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>

</h3>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">When people think of the Menasha Blue Jays, cross country isn’t the first sport that comes to mind. Menasha High, like many schools, is primarily known for its football team. When Coach Tony started three years ago, there were only five students running cross country, even though the sport was popular across the greater area. “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">We are in the center of possibly some of the best cross country programs in the state of Wisconsin,” Tony said, “How can we be part of that and what does that look like?”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">It started with recruiting more runners, but also meant outfitting everyone with the right equipment. In the beginning, “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">We had kids that were running in basketball shoes,</span><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">” recalled Tony. Leah Schapiro from the local Fleet Feet Fox Valley store stepped in to help. She knew the support inside the shoes was just as important as the shoes themselves. The donations started small at first, but by this past season, the Blue Jays cross country team had proper running footwear outfitted with Superfeet insoles. Thanks to Coach Tony’s dedication and inspiring approach, the team grew to 28 runners from a variety of backgrounds, including neurodivergent students and students from immigrant families. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>

</h3>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Leah from Fleet Feet first started donating like-new running shoes that came back to her store as returns. She has been able to increase her donations and add Superfeet to the mix for the most recent season. Having the right footwear certainly made a difference from years past, but it wasn’t until this past season that the Blue Jays made true strides in performance. The team’s growth and hard work were the most important factors leading to their success. Still, Tony isn’t shy about sharing how Superfeet also played an essential role. They were able to train harder with less injuries, increasing their distance from 12-15 miles per week to 25-30. “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">We had six kids that made all-conference this year,</span><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">” Tony proudly declared. “</span><span data-contrast=""none"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">The insoles are part of that journey for us to do that.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"" data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span></p>

</h3>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Running is hard work, especially training for a large race or running competitively, but the rewards are always worth it.

"997541806447","test-how-3d-printed-me3d-personalized-insoles-are-made","MERGE","TEST: How 3D-Printed ME3D Personalized Insoles are Made","Andrej Ciho","<p>Superfeet ME3D personalized insoles provide unique benefits tailor-made (literally!) to your feet. Thanks to state-of-the-art comprehensive assessment tools in hundreds of running and sporting goods stores, your biometric data can be analyzed and used to craft premium insoles perfectly attuned to not just the shape of your feet but the way your feet move as well.</p>
<p>These incredible data insights set ME3D personalized insoles apart from most custom insoles made from foam or plaster molds. But the biometric data that goes into each pair of ME3Ds is only half the story.</p>
<p>The meticulous 3D-printing and hand-assembly process is equally cutting-edge and fascinating. Let’s take a look at how premium ME3D personalized insoles are made to order.</p>
<p><iframe title=""YouTube video player"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UCBEZ6NH44?si=wBKjw5cQAdWXrs4d"" height=""315"" width=""560"" allowfullscreen="""" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Are ME3D personalized insoles really all individually 3D-printed?<br>In short, yes. The data from your in-store scans is translated into the cap of the insole, which forms the support structure around the heel and under the arch. Your 3D foot scan provides measurements like foot size and arch height while the pressure plate records where each foot experiences the most and least amounts of pressure through the entire gait cycle—from the moment your heel hits the ground to the second your toes lift off.</p>
<p>The way each area of the foot experiences pressure effects five independent support zones built into the ME3D cap that can be individually tuned to be flexible, firm, or somewhere in between. The timing and distribution of forces during each step determine the angle (ranging from -30° to 30°) of directional flex lines seen on the bottom of the cap. These flex lines help guide your foot during the gait cycle.</p>
<p>But enough about the data, let’s get into the printing. Superfeet uses multiple industrial 3D printers at our production facility in Washington state to print the personalized cap for each individual ME3D insole. They always come in pairs, but the right and left insole caps from the same order can differ slightly in flex lines and support zones because right and left feet belonging to the same person can be slightly different sizes or have subtly different movement patterns.</p>
<p>The 3D printers, each about the size of a small car, use a polyamide powder mixed with fluid detailing and fusing agents to build the caps one fraction-of-a-millimeter layer at a time. The printers can build 140 caps in each batch. The curves of the caps, standing on their side edge instead of flat, can be seen forming slowly yet meticulously over 12 to 16 hours.</p>
<p>Once the batch is done, like a giant ink cartridge getting taken out of a normal office printer, the filing-cabinet-sized build unit is wheeled from the 3D printer to a processing station. The excess polyamide powder is vacuumed away revealing the ME3D caps. The powder is recycled and combined with new powder for another build.</p>
<h2>How does a 3D-printed cap get turned into a finished insole?</h2>
<p>Once the caps have been cleaned, they are ready to be glued to high quality energizing foam to form the perfect cushioned yet supportive insole. Because each cap is unique, they are checked and organized by hand to make sure the correct left and right pairs go together. You can customize your ME3Ds with your name on the back of each insole, so it’s important insoles with the same name stay together!</p>
<p>Each personalized insole cap is glued by hand to the premium foam layer and vacuum-formed together for a lasting seal. The caps are then double checked to make sure they are the correct pair and placed into the corresponding box—which also has your name on it.</p>
<p>The ME3D production process combines the precision of the latest 3D-printing technology with the quality assurance that comes with assembling products by hand. Our facility in Washington state turns raw powder and foam pieces into premium products that help people move through the world and enjoy life on their feet.</p>

"997557174639","superfeet-2024-year-in-review","MERGE","Superfeet 2024 Year in Review","Superfeet","<p>Superfeet had an incredible year in 2024, and it wouldn’t been possible without you, our amazing Superfeet fans. We’re proud to support you on all your adventures big and small, from conquering mountain trails to setting a new PR to powering through a long workday. This year was one of our busiest yet, in all the best ways. In fact, it was downright award-winning. From paralympic medals to “Best Places to Work” lists, Superfeet played a part in so many high points throughout the year. We also introduced brand-new insoles specifically designed for workers on their feet, partnered with elite athletes, and continued to give back to organizations creating a happier, healthier world. Here are just a few of the many highlights from the past year.</p>
<h3>Introducing Work Cushion and Work Slim-Fit Cushion Insoles </h3>
<p>In February, <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/meet-superfeet-work-support-that-works-as-hard-as-you-do"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/meet-superfeet-work-support-that-works-as-hard-as-you-do"">we launched</a> two new insoles engineered for people who work long hours on their feet with a design that fits well in work and safety toe footwear. Both <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"">Work Cushion</a> and <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-slim-fit-cushion"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-slim-fit-cushion"">Work Slim-Fit Cushion</a> deliver durable, anti-fatigue support that can help alleviate stress on your joints and back, not just your feet. If you’ve got some room in your boots, Work Cushion insoles can replace the flat, unsupportive removable liners that came in them. If you wear shoes at work that look more like running or athletic footwear, Work Slim-Fit Cushion insoles are a great choice, again replacing the factory liner.</p>
<h3>Partnering with Elite Athletes</h3>
<p>Over the summer, we partnered with track and field athletes who use Superfeet to help them train harder and get the most out of every step. Everyone from sprinters and hurdlers to discus throwers and pole vaulters all trust Superfeet to help them perform at their best, and each have a story as unique as their sport. We were proud to help tell their stories and could not be more excited for <a title=""https://www.instagram.com/_brittnnii/"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/_brittnnii/"">Brittni Mason</a>, who recently won a silver medal in the 100m at the Paralympic Games in Paris.</p>

Known for their rich history in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), the Rangers have a strong reputation for producing NHL-caliber players. Similarly, as the official insole partner of the PWHL, we’re thrilled to support the league’s incredible athletes by enhancing their performance and comfort on the ice.</span></p>
<h3>Workplace Awards</h3>
<p>This year, Superfeet was chosen for two different lists recognizing the best places to work. First, we made <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/superfeet-wins-recognition-in-inc-s-best-workplaces-2025"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/superfeet-wins-recognition-in-inc-s-best-workplaces-2025"">Inc. Magazine’s Best Workplaces</a> list, with impressive survey results showing 98% of Superfeet employees agree they can depend on their teammates, 97% of employees indicate they understand how their job contributes to the company's success, 97% report they feel</p>
<p>treated with respect by colleagues, and 96% of employees believe the company is positioned for success.</p>
<p>Not long after that, Superfeet was recognized by <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/superfeet-named-one-of-outside-magazine-s-best-places-to-work-in-2024"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/superfeet-named-one-of-outside-magazine-s-best-places-to-work-in-2024"">Outside Magazine</a> as one of the best places to work in 2024. The list awards companies that prioritize employee well-being, foster a positive work culture, and promote outdoor adventure and environmental stewardship.</p>
<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>Every year, Superfeet donates 1% of sales to organizations local and global who are helping to create a strong foundation for a healthy future. On a global scale, we strengthened partnerships with global partners like Protect Our Winters, The Conservation Alliance, and the Running Industry Diversity Coalition. Superfeet also donated more than $100,000 dollars in one day at our annual Giving Fair to local organizations based near our headquarters in Whatcom County, Washington. We also recognized the amazing work they do with our <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/meet-the-2024-superfeet-local-grant-recipients"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/company-news/meet-the-2024-superfeet-local-grant-recipients"">local grants program</a>. At our annual All-Company Volunteer Day, Superfeet team members helped restore natural habitats by clearing ivy and removing invasive blackberry bushes.</p>
<h3>Here’s to 2025</h3>
<p>Looking back at 2024, our team is proud of all the incredible moments – the recognition, the partnerships, and the immense work and talent poured into new product launches. But, most of all, we’re especially honored that you’ve continued to choose Superfeet as essential part of your life.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"" class=""page-title"">Hiking in the Midwest tends to get a bad rap—at least from those who don’t live here. Sandwiched between the Rockies to the west and the Appalachians to the east, the mostly flat Midwest is indeed dominated by the farmland you expect. But the thing is, that’s not all you’ll find. Hikers can indeed discover plenty of forests, cliffs, and prairie to explore—you just need to know where to find them. Here are nine outstanding Midwestern hikes to get you started.</p>

<h4 data-mce-fragment=""1"">1. Starved Rock State Park, Ottawa, Ill.</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Less than a two-hour drive southwest of Chicago,<span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span><a title=""https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/StarvedRock.aspx"" href=""https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/StarvedRock.aspx"">Starved Rock State Park</a><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span>is a welcome treasure that seems out of place in central Illinois. There you’ll find 18 canyons that were formed by melting glaciers thousands of years ago, and the exposed sandstone formations provide some of the best hiking in the state. Climb the bluffs to get an impressive view of the Illinois River. In the spring and after heavy rains, you’ll find 14 different waterfalls throughout the state park, all within a relatively small area. Hikers will find just over a dozen miles of hiking trails to explore. The area around the signature Starved Rock lookout is always crowded (but still worth it), but the farther east you go the more likely you’ll be to find some solitude among the forested trails.</p>
<h4 data-mce-fragment=""1"">2. Shawnee State Forest, Herod, Ill.</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Occupying the southern tip of Illinois between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers,<span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span><a title=""http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/shawnee/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=10685&amp;actid=29"" href=""http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/shawnee/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=10685&amp;actid=29"">Shawnee National Forest</a><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span>is an enormous natural refuge, occupying more than 280,000 acres. Hikers will find more than 400 miles of trails to explore, but the Garden of the Gods is the one section that really stands out. Classified as an ""uplifted sandstone plateau"" by geologists, the area is filled with rocky bluffs and odd rock formations that offer endless hiking options. The surrounding forest is relatively new growth pines and hardwoods planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. But now nearly 90 years later, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better forest canopy in the Midwest.</p>
<h4 data-mce-fragment=""1"">3. Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Strong City, Kan.</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Many Midwest hikes offer the same kinds of forests, rocks, and rivers found in many other parts of the country. Not so with the<span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span><a title=""https://www.nps.gov/tapr/index.htm"" href=""https://www.nps.gov/tapr/index.htm"">Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve</a>. The Flint Hills region of eastern Kansas and north central Oklahoma features the largest remaining tallgrass prairie on the continent. While this ecosystem once covered more than 170 million acres, most of it was plowed over to create farmland. The rocky soil in the Flint Hills kept this section of the tallgrass intact for you to explore today. It’s an area unlike most any other place you’ve ever hiked, with rolling hills surrounded by treeless vistas, seasonal wildflowers, and bison herds. More than 40 miles of trail are available to help you discover what the prairie was once like before the settlers arrived.</p>
<h4 data-mce-fragment=""1"">4. Superior Hiking Trail, Silver Bay, Minn.</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The 300-plus mile<span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span><a title=""http://superiorhiking.org/"" href=""http://superiorhiking.org/"">Superior Hiking Trail</a><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span>follows the ridgeline overlooking Lake Superior in Northern Minnesota from just south of Duluth to the Canadian border. While it has become a popular thru-hike destination, the trail is designed with many opportunities for day hikes—you’ll find trailheads every 5 to 10 miles along the entire route, and there are nearly 100 backcountry camping sites for any overnight trips. On the trail, discover just about everything this part of the country is known for— including scenic overlooks, lots of water, vast sections of birch, aspen, pine, and cedar, and a fair amount of climbing up and down the ridgeline. The section around Silver Bay is a favorite, with a great overlook of Lake Superior and a waterfall along the Baptism River.</p>
<h4 data-mce-fragment=""1"">5. Black Hills National Forest, Custer, S.D.</h4>

One of the most iconic hikes is to the top of Harney Peak, the highest point east of the Rockies and the Pyrenees in Europe, which rises to 7,242 feet. You’ll obviously have to do some climbing, but the 7-mile, round-trip trek from Sylvan Lake is of moderate difficulty, and well-worth the effort when you get to the top. For those looking for more of a challenge, the northern approach is close to double the amount of elevation gain in about a 10-mile round-trip.  </p>

The upper falls of the Tahquamenon River is one of the largest waterfalls east of the Mississippi at nearly 200 feet across and 50 feet high, dropping more than 50,000 gallons a second at its peak water flow. About four miles downstream, you’ll find a series of lower falls that aren’t as big but are just as scenic. The 4.8-mile trail connecting the two makes for an excellent day hike, with lots of dense forest cover and a good chance to view wildlife, including moose.</p>

The longest trail is 3.5 miles long—Trail No. 8—and explores the ravines in the more remote sections of the park. It’s of moderate difficulty and features a very nice trip along the tree-covered path and around Ogle Lake. Come in the fall for some of the best leaf-peeping in the state.</p>

<p><span>Here’s what Superfeet team members Heather and Esther shared about their experience at the 2024 Take the Lead retreat.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why was it important for Superfeet to take part in Take the Lead?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Heather:</strong><span> As a longtime Superfeet employee, it feels incredibly rewarding to know that the company continually invests in my growth and development. Attending this amazing event, surrounded by a community of incredible women, reminds me of the power of connection and inspiration. It’s a space where I can show up fully as myself, build meaningful relationships, and embrace new opportunities for personal and professional growth. I'm grateful to be part of a company that values its people and empowers us to thrive both inside and outside of the workplace.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Esther</strong><strong>:</strong><span> It’s crucial for Superfeet to support women and femmes of color in our industry. This group is often overlooked, and the support Superfeet provides is invaluable—not only for our team members but also for other BIPOC women and femmes attending this retreat.</span></p>

<h2><strong>What were your takeaways from this retreat?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Heather:</strong><span> You are not alone in your journey—many people are navigating similar experiences, and you can connect with them for support and shared understanding. Your path won’t always be linear; there will be unexpected twists. I found inspiration in so many of Jenny Nguyen’s words, the owner and founder of The Sports Bra, as she shared her journey of coming out, her rise to success, and the impact she’s made in women’s sports.</span></p>
<p><span>I also gained valuable insights into how major brands in the running industry are shaping their influencer and athlete programs, along with emerging trends. It reassured me that I’m heading in the right direction with our sports and creator strategy.</span></p>
<p><span>This retreat is always a powerful reminder to take up space, use my voice, and stay true to myself. I leave feeling energized and empowered, with that energy continuing long after I return home.</span></p>
<p><span>One of my favorite quotes from Jenny Nguyen:</span><em><span> “Be compassionate and be ruthless.”</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Esther</strong><span>: My biggest takeaway was the importance of allyship. During our “Stride by Stride, Allyship in Action” workshop with Coach Bey, she shared some eye-opening data: while 80% of white employees see themselves as allies to women of color, only 45% of Black women and 55% of Latinx women feel they have strong allies in their workplaces. This highlights the need to actively listen, learn, amplify voices, yield space, and support this group.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What was your most memorable moment?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Heather:<span> </span></strong><span>There were countless moments that left me feeling inspired, but one of the highlights was listening to Jenny Nguyen speak about her journey. Her story was so raw, authentic, and incredibly relatable. I found myself connecting deeply with two aspects in particular: her experience of coming out and the realization that it's okay to not always be “on.” Sometimes, life demands rest, and it's perfectly fine to take that time—being productive isn’t always about constant action.</span></p>
<p><span>Another memorable part of the retreat was the hike we took. Reaching the top and having the chance to journal in nature was so refreshing. There’s something next level about putting thoughts to paper while surrounded by the beauty of the outdoors.</span></p>
<p><span>While there were so many amazing aspects of the </span><em><span>Take the Lead</span></em><span> event, what stands out the most is the connection with other inspiring women. Sharing space with them was truly the most empowering part of the experience.</span></p>
<p><strong>Esther</strong><strong>:<span> </span></strong><span>The most memorable moment for me was the hike up Wildwood Trail to Pittock Mansion, especially the writing exercise we did with a view of the city. I don’t typically journal, but our guide, Junghuan Liu, inspired me to put pen to paper by starting us off with a line from a poem. It truly sparked my creativity!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Any other thoughts you’d like to add?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Heather:<span> </span></strong><span>The value in the connections, insights, and inspiration that come from being part of a space intentionally designed for us is unmatched. The work is never done, but together, we can all make a difference—both for the brands we work for and in the world around us. I’m already looking forward to the next Take the Lead! </span></p>
<p><strong>Esther:<span> </span></strong><span>The sense of community at TTL was palpable, and much of what I learned resonated with the work our DEI Pillar does. I’ve often been “the only” in a room, but this event reminded us that we’re not alone. Many inspiring women encouraged us to believe in ourselves and pursue our goals. I’m incredibly grateful to have attended TTL, and I truly appreciate both my team and the support our company provides for events like this.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Superfeet: Congrats on your third marathon. What inspired you to run the Chicago Marathon this year? </b></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><strong>Coach Morgan:</strong></span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was inspired to run my third consecutive Chicago Marathon this year by the group that I run with out of Chicago’s westside, called </span><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peace_runners773/"" title=""Peacerunners773.com""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peacerunners773</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Peacerunners773 is an amazing non-profit organization that I have been part of since its inception three years ago. They focus on holistic health and wellness in underserved communities especially on the west side of Chicago the Garfield Park and North Lawndale neighborhoods. I previously taught elementary school and coached girls basketball in these communities. Peacerunners773 has given me a tremendous amount of belief in myself that all things are possible and has helped me understand the importance of health and wellness especially in our communities and our neighborhoods on Chicago's Westside and throughout the city of Chicago. Last year, I completed the Chicago Distance series which gave me guaranteed entry into the Chicago Marathon 2024. The Chicago distance series started off with the Shamrock Shuffle (Sunday, March 26, 2023) which is an 8K, then 13.1 half marathon (Sunday, June 9, 2023) and then the Chicago Marathon. Completing these three events allowed me guaranteed entry into the 2024 Chicago Marathon so that's what made me take advantage of that opportunity, knowing that marathons are really difficult to get into via the lottery system. I also want to continue to set an example for the 6th-12th grade girls that I coach, and my son Corey II (6 years old) and my daughter Legacy (3 years old).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br><br></span></p>
<p><b>Superfeet: How did you prepare for the race—any specific training tips or routines? </b></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> I prepared for this race by doing a tremendous amount of yoga. I pretty much</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">did yoga 5 days a week. Shoutout to our yoga instructor Mia who helped me with this. I also did a lot of strength training. I had two gentlemen who were really significant in my strength training journey, Julius Charles, who is a member of Peace Runners 773 and Corry Tibbs, who is a childhood friend of mine. Both of them were monumental in helping me to get significantly stronger as I approached this year's marathon. Peacerunners773 also provided us with multiple options every week to get in training runs in a group setting. On Wednesdays, we did a run which had a three or five mile option. On Saturday mornings we did a two mile community run, and on Sundays we would do our long runs together.  Having a group to train with really gave me a tremendous support system and a tremendous amount of belief that together we would get these runs in and we would be able to conquer whatever the distance. My biggest tip or piece of advice to anyone thinking about running a marathon, half marathon, or 5K would be simply get with a great community of runners. Get with a run club — if you’re in Chicago, you should definitely consider joining Peace Runners773.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Superfeet: What was the most challenging part of your marathon journey? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan: </b></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This training block provided me with a few different obstacles that I had to overcome. I was injured during this training block on three separate occasions. All three injuries were to my left hamstring, so I wasn't sure if I was going to make it to the starting line for the Chicago Marathon. I wasn't sure how marathon would go if I was able to make it to the starting line, but I received some physical therapy out at Tribal connection in Libertyville, some individual physical therapy sessions with physical therapist Nia Green and some well strength and run mechanics training with Julius Charles that really really helped get me back healthy. All of those things put me over the top to ensure that I was ready to take on the start line at the Chicago Marathon this year. Three separate injuries during this training block was a lot to overcome mentally, physically, as well as emotionally but I just stayed, prayed up and kept my belief in God. Through God and my support system, I was able to get it done and make it happen.</span></p>

<p><b>Superfeet: Can you share a memorable moment from the race?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: </span></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I had a few very memorable moments from this year's marathon. The main thing was just having my family and my friends there to support me and cheer me on along the way. Right as I was getting ready to approach the Mile 16 marker,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">my basketball coaching staff that coaches high school girls basketball with me, which included Gianni Ortiz, Alexis Williams, Jakira Brown and Shamona McDaniel, were waiting to cheer me on, holding big signs and just screaming for me. Six members of the DePaul College Prep girls basketball team were also there —I am the head coach of their varsity program. Then, a few feet in front of them was my sister Tiara Nelson, my mom, my mother-in-law, my auntie, my sister in-law, my beautiful wife Luevinia Morgan, my son and my daughter, my cousin Deja and my other little sister Nakia. Right across the street from them was my run club and some of my run brothers just hyped me up.  Julius Charles was there along with major clay Jackie Hoffman and they jumped and they yelled and they screamed and they gave me a tremendous amount of energy as I went towards mile 16. I was overcome with joy and emotion just having that full circle moment with a lot of people who I've trained with and who I've run with over these years.  Them being there just did something to me and it made me emotional. I had to catch myself and take a deep breath. My training partner Jaidin, my yoga coach Mia, and my hype buddy Velle were all right there yelling and screaming for me. My pace buddy Dee as well, they were all just right there supporting me making sure I had everything that I needed to finish the race strong. Right before I approached mile 24 I saw my former elementary school gifted reading teacher who said, “I've been out here waiting for you Corey I've been tracking you all day and my phone died but I wasn't leaving until I saw you.” When I saw Mrs. Dr Lang I was overcome with joy and emotion. That catapulted me through the last 2.2 miles of the race.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></p>

<p><b>Superfeet: How did you feel crossing the finish line?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan: </b></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crossing the finish line this year made me feel a different sense of pride and joy because of the fact that I had suffered three different injuries during my race training. My distance PR for this calendar year was only 13.1 miles. I completed that distance six times prior to the marathon and I did seven 10 mile runs, but I wasn't able to complete any of the longer runs because during that stretch I was injured.  I was doing a lot of biking and some smaller runs as it got a little bit closer to the actual marathon date. I felt tremendously blessed knowing that I had only that I hadn't ran more than 13.1 miles this year. Completing the entire marathon at 26.2 miles was a big feat and a huge accomplishment and something that I hold my head high knowing I was able to conquer that beast!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br><b></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Superfeet: What advice would you give to someone considering running a marathon for the first time?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan:</b></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Some advice that I would give to a person who is considering running a marathon for the first time would be make sure you stretch and make sure you strength train. Take strength training very seriously as it has helped me tremendously. Definitely run with a group and get a training plan. We follow the training plan provided in the Nike Run Club app and that gave me structure in my runs. Also make sure that you prioritize recovery.  Recovery is sleep. Recovery is also Normatec boots, epsom salt hot baths, cold tubs, cryo chambers, and  massage. All of those things help your body recover faster and help you tremendously in your marathon training journey. </span></p>
<p><b>Superfeet: What’s next on your running journey? Any upcoming races or goals?</b><b><br></b><b></b></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8dc63f;""><b>Coach Morgan:</b></span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coming up next for me on my run journey, I am running the Hot Chocolate Chicago 5K race with my wife, my son and my niece. My wife and I did it together last year for the first time and my son is joining us, as well as my 9-year-old niece. We're doing it as a family so I’m tremendously excited about that. Following that I'm going to have a strong off-season where I'm going to take my strength training to the next level to get stronger in the off-season and to have a more balanced diet. I'll be running and biking through the winter to continue to keep my stamina up at a high level. Next year I'm going to focus on shorter distances and getting a little bit faster in those shorter distances. That's something I’m excited about, to see the runner that I become within the next year!</span><b></b></p>

<p>Switching all the lights at Superfeet headquarters in Washington state to efficient LEDs was no small feat, but it was an important step forward in helping reduce energy consumption. Yet even with Superfeet HQ consuming less electricity, we still wanted to make sure the energy we were using came from renewable sources. That’s why we’ve invested in Renewable Energy Certified (REC) electricity to power the entire building – including office spaces, shipping and production facilities. </p>

"997372395887","trail-running-in-yosemite-national-park-an-insider-s-guide","MERGE","Trail Running in Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Superfeet","<p>With routes that wind under giant sequoias, through meadows full of wildflowers, and in the shadow of Half Dome and El Capitan, Yosemite National Park is indeed a trail runner’s paradise. The 704,000-acre park boasts more than 750 miles of trails, offering runners a seemingly endless bounty of natural beauty to explore. And for runners who want to put their trail running skills up against some competition, official races like the Shadow of the Giants 50K and the Smokey Bear Run add an element of competition while showing off the park’s stunning wilderness.</p>
<p>However and wherever you hit the trail, though, you’ll have a vast network of options to choose from. But, depending on what time of year you go, you could be dealing with quite the crowds. Yosemite is one of the most visited national parks in the country, hosting nearly 4 million annual visitors that swell to Disney-like sizes in the summer. The silver lining, however, is that most of the masses are walking or hiking, and many people tend to stick to areas right around the trailheads. Make your way even a mile or so beyond that, and you’ll leave the majority, literally, in the dust. Another strategy: Make a beeline for the far less-traveled trails of the High Country, with a fraction of the crowds you’ll find in the valley.</p>
<p>Here’s how to follow in John Muir’s footsteps (wearing your trail running shoes, of course).</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-trail-running-02_ygihu7-min_480x480.webp?v=1727211034"" alt=""Yosemite Trail Running"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p>For flat, relatively easy runs, Yosemite Valley—the seven-mile-long, one-mile-wide stretch that’s home to some of the park’s most iconic waterfalls and rock formations—is your best bet. The Merced River splits the valley and its trails, and you can easily do out-and-backs to some of the landmarks like El Capitan, the 3,000-foot granite monolith that attracts the best climbers in the world; Camp 4, generally known as the birthplace of rock-climbing and now on the National Register of Historic Places; and scenic waterfalls, including Lower Yosemite Falls and Bridalveil Fall. Trails here can be easily accessed via most accommodations in the valley, but route-finding can be tricky in some spots, so carrying a trail map is advisable for first-timers.</p>
<p>For a somewhat longer excursion, the 11.5-mile Valley Loop Trail, which can also be done as a 7.2-mile half-loop, and traces many of the Valley’s first east-west trails and wagon roads. (The route is a hybrid of dirt, rocks, sand, and old pavement, so pick a pair of trail shoes with good support.) Start the route from the Lower Yosemite Fall area and head west along the base of the Three Brothers rock formation past Camp 4, eventually working your way to El Cap—an ideal spot to catch your breath as you gaze up at the world’s largest continuous slab of granite (bonus points if you can spot any climbers with your naked eye).</p>
<p>If you’re tackling the full route, continue west past El Cap toward Bridalveil Fall; for the shortened route, cross the river at El Capitan Bridge and head east toward Yosemite Village. Pro tip: If you’re visiting in the high season and not spending the night in the park, it’s smart to drive all the way around the valley’s one-way roads and park along the side of the road of Northside Drive (it will be much more crowded in the summer) or in the day-use lots near Yosemite Valley Lodge.</p>
<p>For a more strenuous run near the Wawona area of the park, which is easily accessed from the south gate, pick from several routes near the historic Big Trees Hotel (formerly the Wawona Hotel) that range from 3.5 miles to 12 miles. A couple of hardcore highlights include the 12-mile trip to Alder Falls, which starts about 0.4 miles up Chilnuala Falls Road (look for the “Backcountry Use” sign) and winds through an open pine forest; and the Chilnuala Falls route, which is shorter distance-wise (8.2 miles round-trip) but a real grinder, with 2,400 feet of elevation gain along the switch-back heavy route, which eventually opens up to spectacular views of the Wawona area.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Stream running through Yosemite National Park"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-trail-running-03_bs7wne-min_480x480.webp?v=1727211120""></div>


<p>For a true high Sierra adventure, runners can explore the equally spectacular, but somewhat less crowded, eastern region of the park, Tuolumne Meadows. The area is still popular, but it’s also very spread out, meaning you probably won’t be bumping elbows with fellow outdoor enthusiasts as you explore the trails. For easy, flat runs, hit the trails around the meadow itself, including routes that pass Soda Springs and its carbonated, cold water bubbling out of the ground, and along the Tuolumne River and other interesting landmarks.</p>
<p>For longer runs, you can string together any number of loops or out-and-back routes to add elevation and mileage. A few recommended options include Lyell Canyon to the historic John Muir Trail (8 miles round-trip; 200 feet elevation gain); a 4.8-mile round-trip route to Elizabeth Lake, which climbs steadily to a glacier-carved lake at the base of Unicorn Peak (about 1,000 feet of elevation gain); and an 11-mile excursion to Glen Aulin, following the Tuolumne River past two waterfalls as the trail winds its way down to the Glen Aulin High Sierra Camp (past the camp are several more waterfalls that offer scenic incentives to add on mileage if you like).</p>
<p>A few things to remember for trail running in this part of the park: Tioga Pass, the road from the park’s western and southern entrances to reach East Yosemite, is usually closed due to snow until May, so plan your trip accordingly. In addition, don’t forget your water bottle and filter. You’ll need them in this neck of the woods to stay hydrated safely. Don’t forget to take advantage of the free shuttle service that makes stops at several trailheads, and which operates from May through November. And finally, don’t be surprised if even a short run leaves you winded; elevation in the High Sierra starts around 8,000 feet.</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 16:53:13 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:26 -0400","true","2024-09-24 16:53:13 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/yosemite-trail-running-01_egzqgb-min.jpg?v=1727211909","2048","1366","Trail Running in Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","30","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trail Running In Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to trail running in Yosemite National Park.

<hr>
<p>A weekend in Yosemite is an ideal way for outdoor-loving travelers to reconnect with nature. There are options for all levels of adventurers, from hardcore backcountry backpacking trips to cushy digs right within the park. But because Yosemite is such a popular place, especially in the summer high season, planning a weekend getaway requires some legwork. (Keep in mind that the park recently changed its concessionaire, and as a result, names of lodging and other landmarks have changed.) Here are some tips on making the most of your time there.</p>
<h2>1. Plan As Far Ahead as Possible</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""With cozy, heated canvas tents and restrooms, Half Dome Village is one of Yosemite’s most popular accommodations."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-weekend-guide-03_cflbjv-min_480x480.webp?v=1727211327""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>With cozy, heated canvas tents and restrooms, Half Dome Village is one of Yosemite’s most popular accommodations.  - </span><em>Miguel Vieira</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Depending on when you visit, the crowds in Yosemite Valley can feel alarmingly Disney-esque. That’s not to say a weekend visit isn’t well worth it, but you’ll need to do some advance planning to secure lodging or a campsite. The most popular accommodations, <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://www.yosemite.com/lodging/hotels/yosemite-valley-lodge/"" target=""_blank"">Yosemite Valley Lodge</a>, Half Dome Village, and the grand dame property, the Majestic Yosemite Hotel (formerly the Ahwahnee; even if you don’t stay there, cocktails on the patio are highly recommended) fill up months in advance. For the valley’s car campgrounds, reservations are required March 15 through November, as well as summer through fall for Crane Flat, Wawona, Hodgdon Meadow, and half of Tuolumne Meadows. Reservations become available on the 15th of each month at 7 am Pacific time and often fill up in minutes. It’s helpful to have alternate dates in mind as you make reservations, and keep in mind that weekdays often offer more flexibility.</p>
<h2>2. Consider an Offseason Visit</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-weekend-guide-05_yk8o7j-min_480x480.webp?v=1727211398"" alt=""Half Dome is perhaps the most iconic rock formation in Yosemite National Park."" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Half Dome is perhaps the most iconic rock formation in Yosemite National Park. Dimitry B.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Imagine a crisp fall hike under a canopy of changing leaves or cross-country skiing through the giant sequoias. Indeed, Yosemite is blissfully serene in the offseason, when crowds thin out and nature seems to breathe a sigh of relief. Winter can be an especially rewarding time to visit, especially if it’s warm—in fact, climbers Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell made their historic climb on El Capitan in January. But there’s plenty of snow-centric fun, too: cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and even downhill skiing (the park’s on-site ski area is unpretentious, affordable, and a great spot for families.) Keep in mind that Tioga Road, the main access to the eastern parts of the park, is closed from October through May depending on snowfall.</p>
<h2>3. Explore Beyond Yosemite Valley</h2>
<hr>
<p>Some 90 percent of the park’s travelers stick to Yosemite Valley, which makes up less than five percent of its total size. In other words, exploring some of the lesser-visited parts of the park—Hetch Hetchy, Wawona, Tuolumne Grove, Merced Grove, and Tuolumne Meadows, just to name a few—can make all the difference in ensuring some solitude in nature during your visit. If you do stick to the valley (and there are certainly some world-class hikes there), take heart that the masses generally start to disperse the farther (or higher) you go from the trailhead, especially on routes like Lower and Upper Yosemite Falls, and the John Muir Trail.</p>
<h2>4. Consider Camping in the Nearby National Forest</h2>
<hr>
<p>Unable to snag reservations anywhere in the park? Don’t fret: Consider the free DIY <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/stanislaus/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=14833&amp;actid=34"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">dispersed camping</a> (read: no toilets, drinking water, bear lockers, or campfires) on <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/stanislaus/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=14833&amp;actid=34"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">national forest land </a>adjacent to the park.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t Forget the Map and Binoculars</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Don’t forget the binoculars to try to spot climbers on El Capitan, which draws big-name climbers from all over the world."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-weekend-guide-04_afutau-min_480x480.webp?v=1727211519""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Don’t forget the binoculars to try to spot climbers on El Capitan, which draws big-name climbers from all over the world. - </span><em>Phil</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You’ll find plenty of modern-day conveniences in Yosemite—a well-stocked grocery store, comfy digs—but strong phone signals aren’t one of them. Cell phone signals are spotty, at best, and at most points in the park, nonexistent. Make sure to keep a good, old-fashioned map handy, especially when hiking or driving on remote roads. And while binoculars might seem like an old-school extra, you’ll be glad you have them when you’re savoring the vistas from various viewpoints and trying to spot climbers on crags like El Capitan.</p>
<h2>6. Avoid Driving if Possible (Especially During the High Season)</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can explore many areas of Yosemite without needing a vehicle, reducing headaches over parking and traffic. <a tabindex=""-1"" href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/publictransportation.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Free shuttles</a> circulate around the valley year-round and along Tioga Road during summer. Another under-appreciated way of exploring the valley (and avoiding traffic): <a tabindex=""-1"" href=""https://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/biking/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">bicycling</a> (rentals available, or bring your own wheels). Get rolling on 12 miles of paved trails in the valley to take advantage of superb views of Yosemite Falls and access to popular sites like Mirror Lake.</p>
<p>No avoiding the car? Then fuel up long before arriving at the park, as gas prices increase the closer you get to entrances. Getting an early start is also highly recommended, and keep in mind that the roads around Yosemite Valley are one-way. It’s much easier to pull into a site and then keep driving if you decide not to explore it on foot than looping back around.</p>
<h2>7. Take Advantage of the Programming</h2>
<hr>
<p>Yosemite is one of the most well-funded parks in the country, so take the opportunity to see your tax dollars at work with some of the park’s excellent (and free) nature <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/ranger-nature-programs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">programs and events</a>: film screenings, moonlight hikes, and ranger walk and talks, just to name a few.

"997372330351","hiking-in-yosemite-national-park-an-insider-s-guide","MERGE","Hiking in Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Superfeet","<p>With a backdrop of stunning landscapes—including soaring granite domes, alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and endless acres of backcountry wilderness—hiking in Yosemite National Park is nirvana for any outdoors enthusiast. A vast network of trails throughout the 704,000-acre park means there’s a dizzying array of options for hikes and hikers, from full day outings with thousands of feet of elevation gain to easy, flat strolls through Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p>As sublime as it is, hiking in Yosemite requires some pre-planning, especially in the high season between Memorial Day and Labor Day, when crowds in the park are at their peak. The good news, however, is that the masses often thin out a mile or so past the trailhead. In the high season, taking the free shuttle that loops throughout the valley and stops at various trailheads is a highly recommended way to get around (keep in mind that with a recent concessionaire switch at Yosemite, names of lodges and other landmarks have changed). Here’s what you need to know about some of the most popular hikes in Yosemite Valley.</p>
<h2>Easy</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Bridalveil Fall</h3>
<p><br>Dropping 620 feet down, Bridalveil Falls is one of the first sights upon entering Yosemite Valley, so it’s a popular—and easy—way to get a quick fix of fresh air soon after paying your entrance fee. It’s just a half-mile, 20-minute hike to base of the waterfall, which flows year-round; prepare to get wet in the spring, when the falls are thundering. Parking can be tricky in the high season, so if the lot is full, continue up Southside Drive and park in one of two lots to access a trail that crosses Bridalveil Creek and offers different views of the falls as you walk to the base.</p>
<h3>Mirror Lake</h3>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Several hike options at Mirror Lake offers scenic views of the pristine lake."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-hiking-03_bkymma-min_480x480.webp?v=1727210616""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Several hike options at Mirror Lake offers scenic views of the pristine lake. - </span><em>Pixabay</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The name of this popular hike says it all: The lake magnificently reflects the surrounding cliffs in the spring, drawing tons of shutterbugs. It’s also a scenic spot to hit the trail.</p>
<p>For an easy out-and-back, stick to the mile-long paved service road that leads right to the lake. You can also avoid some of the crowds by hiking from the Majestic Yosemite Hotel (formerly the Ahwahnee) down to the Mirror Lake shuttle stop, a 2.8-mile route that’s ideal for families and less experienced hikers. Up for a longer excursion? The five-mile loop around the lake is a lovely option for a day hike, accessible from the end of the paved path. The loop follows Tenaya Creek beyond the lake and crosses two bridges after the Snow Creek Trail junction before returning past the lake on the south side of Tenaya Canyon.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you want to see the lake in its prime, visit during spring and early summer, when Tenaya Creek brims with fresh snowmelt. Visit in late summer, and you may just find it’s turned into “Mirror Meadow,” as it’s also known when the water dries up and grasses and sandy areas dominate the landscape.</p>
<h2>Moderate</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Mist Trail</h3>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-hiking-04_lhshhl-min_480x480.webp?v=1727210690"" alt=""The Mist Trail is one of the most memorable hikes in Yosemite, but prepare for slippery steps and crowds."" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p>The Mist Trail is one of the most memorable hikes in Yosemite, but prepare for slippery steps and crowds. -<span> </span><em>Yosemite Hospitality</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ascending steep granite stairs while getting drenched from the spray of a magnificent waterfall is a must-do while in Yosemite (but this is also one of the most popular hikes in the park, so don’t expect solitude). From the trailhead at Happy Isles, head uphill to the first viewing point at a footbridge about 0.8 miles in. A little further up, the Mist Trail splits with the John Muir Trail; this is where the real fun begins. Stay on the Mist Trail and navigate up about 600 granite steps while the waterfall spray creates an ethereal mist around you—footing is notoriously steep and slippery. Once at the top, delight in straight-down views of the 317-foot falls (obey all signs and don’t cross any railings—a few lives have been lost here).</p>
<p>If you’re up for more hiking and haven’t had your fill of waterfalls, continue up the Mist Trail another 1.5 miles of rocky, steep switchbacks until you reach Nevada Fall: a thundering, 594-foot monster that peaks in spring and early summer (head over the footbridge that crosses the Merced River for a closer look). After a short rest and requisite photos, you can head back down via the Mist Trail (not recommended for anyone with bad knees) or take the longer but gorgeous route along the John Muir Trail. It’s about four miles one way, about a mile and a half longer than the Mist Trail, but serves up spectacular vistas of Liberty Cap and a different view of Nevada Fall.</p>

<h3>Yosemite Falls Trail</h3>
<p>An epic day hike that offers killer views of Yosemite Valley below, this trek ends up at a brag-worthy summit: at the top of North America’s tallest waterfall, which rises 2,425 feet from the valley floor. But prepare to work to get there: One of the park’s oldest historic trails (built from 1873 to 1877) is also one of its toughest, with switchbacks galore and a total of 2,700 feet of elevation gain. The trail is open year-round, but spring is an ideal time to tackle this one, as the falls will be roaring. Plan for about 6-8 hours to complete the hike, which is 7.2 miles round-trip.</p>
<h3>Half Dome</h3>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Start planning far in advance to snag a permit to summit Half Dome, one of Yosemite’s most iconic landmarks."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-hiking-05_nbtm8s-min_480x480.webp?v=1727210887""></div>

<hr>
<p>First ascended in 1875 by outdoorsman George Anderson (who put pine pitch on his shoes to help him from slipping on the smooth granite), Half Dome has evolved to become the feather in the cap for many a Yosemite visitor. But this is no easy walk in the woods: Hiking to the top of Half Dome is crowded (you’ll be sharing the trail with hundreds of other hikers); hardcore (a 14-16 mile round-trip grind with 4,800 feet of elevation gain); and not for anyone with a fear of heights (you’ll reach the summit via cables on the sheer rock face nearly 5,000 feet above the valley).</p>

<p>Because the hike is so popular, obtaining a permit is your first order of business: Only 300 hikers are allowed onto Half Dome each day (225 day hikers and 75 backpackers). And the permitting process, which includes a lottery, is an adventure in itself; study up beforehand on how it works and have alternate dates in mind to maximize your chances of snagging one (the park service offers some excellent beta and tips on <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">securing permits</a>, including a graph that outlines the most popular days).</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 16:49:09 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","true","2024-09-24 16:49:09 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/yosemite-hiking-01_omrtwd-min.jpg?v=1727211909","2048","1365","Hiking in Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","32","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hiking In Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to hiking in Yosemite National Park.

<p>Here, a primer on <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">backpacking in Yosemite</a>, as well as recommendations for specific trips based on your backpacking style.</p>
<h2>Permits and Reservations</h2>
<hr>
<p>It’s often said that John Muir, the renowned outdoorsman with a deep love for Yosemite, often ventured on his wilderness sojourns with little more than some tea, bread, and a sleeping roll slung over his shoulder. These days, however, planning for a backpacking trip is a little more involved—especially in Muir’s beloved stomping grounds. Your first step in planning a backpacking trip in Yosemite will be figuring out where to go (more on that below) and if reservations are available.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermits.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">park’s website </a>details the specifics on the process, but a few key points to keep in mind: free wilderness permits are required year-round for any stay in Yosemite, but permits are only issued to a limited number of people to allow for solitude (smart move, NPS); reservations are highly recommended for popular trails; and first-come, first-served permits are an option if you’re unable to snag a reservation. In addition, any backpacking permit allows you to stay in the backpacker’s campground in Yosemite Valley one night before your departure date and one night after your return. When you make a permit reservation in Yosemite, you’ll specify which trailhead you plan to leave from, and where your first night’s campsite will be.</p>
<h2>Lyell Canyon-Vogelsang Loop</h2>

<h3>Best For: A Taste of High Country Highlights</h3>
<hr>
<p>This 20-mile excursion, which can be stretched over multiple days, winds through some of Yosemite’s most gorgeous, glacier-carved terrain in the High Country, complete with alpine lakes, epic views, and challenging terrain. You’ll start from the Tuolumne Meadows Permit Station, eventually linking up with the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails. The route passes through Lyell Canyon, which is relatively flat and stunningly scenic, thanks to fields of wildflowers, especially in early summer. Then, expect alpine ascents through the forest that leave your quads burning, until you’re rewarded with magnificent views of the Cathedral Range at the top of the ridge between Lyell Canyon and Rafferty Creek. (Choose your camping spot at the top of the ridge wisely, as only a handful of spots have easy access to water.)</p>
<p>From there, the trail descends past stunning alpine lakes, with a couple more campsites at Lake 10,425 (named for its elevation) and Lake Evelyn, and then onto the Vogelsang High Sierra Camp. From the High Sierra Camp, the trail drops to Tuolumne Pass and then into the valley of Rafferty Creek before eventually meeting the Tuolumne River; here, you’ll find the trail you started on.</p>
<p>One word of warning: At elevations around 10,000 feet, altitude sickness is not uncommon, especially for novice backpackers. Take plenty of breaks, stay hydrated, and come prepared with preventative meds just in case.</p>

<h3>Best For: Creature Comforts in the Backcountry</h3>
<p>One of the best-kept secrets of Yosemite (at least, outside the Bay Area) is the <a href=""https://www.travelyosemite.com/lodging/high-sierra-camps/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">High Sierra Camps</a>, which offer a sublime way to experience the backcountry without the hassle of schlepping the requisite gear. Spaced along a loop at six-to-10-mile intervals, the five High Camps are a series of comfy canvas tents, complete with beds and mattresses, along with restrooms (some camps also have showers). But meals are the real star of the show: hearty breakfasts and dinners prepared by a chef, an ideal bookend to a taxing day on the trails. No post-meal plate-scraping here: Instead, amble over to the campfire to relax under the stars before bedding down for the night.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""The Sunrise High Sierra Camp is one of five camps in the high Sierra that provides backpackers with canvas tents and gourmet meals."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-backpacking-02_au2nhi-min_480x480.webp?v=1727210326""></div>

<p>For backpackers who prefer to sleep in their own tents, there’s also a meal-only option for the High Camps, as well as backpackers’ only campsites. Both require a reservation.</p>
<h2>Glen Aulin to Waterwheel Falls</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Best For: Waterfall Seekers</h3>
<p>A wondrous waterfall is the perfect antidote to muscles fatigued from miles on the trail, and on this 18-mile round-trip route (which can be shortened), there’s always another ‘fall to look forward to. To start, follow the Tuolumne River to Glen Aulin, crossing Tuolumne Falls and White Cascade about four miles in. Keep going, and you’ll be treated to California, LeConte, and Waterwheel Falls—all especially refreshing in the summer. Don’t forget a bathing suit, either: White Cascade beckons for a dip in June and July.</p>
<h2>Tuolumne Meadows to Yosemite Valley (via Half Dome)</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Hiking down to Half Dome from an overnight backpacking trip in Tuolumne Meadows is a strategy to avoiding some of the crowds."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/yosemite-backpacking-04_xpe7iy-min_480x480.webp?v=1727210465""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Hiking down to Half Dome from an overnight backpacking trip in Tuolumne Meadows is a strategy to avoiding some of the crowds. - </span><em>Alex Proimo</em></p>
<hr>



<p>Best For: Hikers With Their Heart Set on Half Dome</p>
<p>Most day hikers opt to tackle the supremely popular <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Half Dome</a> hike (which requires one of the park’s most sought-after permits) from Yosemite Valley, a 10-12 hour haul that requires a pre-dawn wakeup call. But an appealing option for backpackers with their sights set on Half Dome is to hike downhill from Tuolumne Meadows via the John Muir Trail or Cloud’s Rest on an overnight trip. Both are dynamite treks in and of themselves, with the 9,931-foot Cloud’s Rest offering a hair-raising ascent (i.e., a narrow, rocky trail with steep drop-offs) on the way to an unbeatable, 360-degree view of Half Dome, El Capitan, and the Cathedral Range.</p>
<p>But if Half Dome is the real draw, this option has a couple of excellent advantages: 1) it saves your legs for the final scramble up the smooth granite of Half Dome; 2) it avoids the notorious crowds, because you can get up earlier and beat them to the base of the cables, where most of the bottlenecks start.</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 16:41:55 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:26 -0400","true","2024-09-24 16:41:55 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/yosemite-backpacking-01_zamfcv-min.jpg?v=1727211909","2048","1536","Backpacking in Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","33","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Backpacking In Yosemite National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to backpacking in Yosemite National Park.

Roosevelt’s first term as president. The 500 miles of trails in the park will keep you busy during the day; the multiple campgrounds and campsites will keep you comfy through the night. Add to that amazing mountain views in all directions and Shenandoah’s got your weekend covered.</p>
<p>Start your trip by driving along the 105-mile Skyline Drive National Scenic Byway through Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. It’s a beautiful drive dotted with gorgeous views and campgrounds, and provides easy access to most of the park’s trails. While all of you weekend warriors out there are aching to get some fresh air, don’t underestimate this drive. Stay in the car a few minutes longer and take in the sights and sounds of one of America’s favorite mountain roads. Not only is it a beauty, but it’ll get you to where you need to be to hike, ride, run, or to just enjoy the beauty of your surroundings during the day or under the stars.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Skyline Drive gently winds 105 miles through the park as it traverses several climbs."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/shenandoah-weekend-guide-02_kdoyed_480x480.webp?v=1727209781""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Skyline Drive gently winds 105 miles through the park as it traverses several climbs. - </span><em>Jason Devaney</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When you first arrive at the park, the best thing to do is to get yourself situated in your lodging for the evening. There are four entrances to the park: the northern and southern ends at Front Royal and Rockfish Gap respectively, along with Thornton Gap (milepost 31.5) and at Swift Run Gap (milepost 62.7). The $20 entrance fee is good for seven days.</p>
<p>You can either camp in the backcountry—on most trails—or at any one of the four campgrounds located off Skyline Drive: Matthews Arm (mile 22.1), Big Meadows (mile 51.2), Lewis Mountain (mile 57.5), and Loft Mountain (mile 79.5). The campgrounds are a great choice for families, but it’s important to make reservations or at the very least, get there early - both Loft Mountain and Matthews Arm leave 80% of their sites available on a first-come-first-served basis. If you are headed out on a<a href=""/shenandoh/backpacking""> backpacking trip</a>, there are hundreds of options because of the vast amount of trails within the park. Be sure you have planned wisely and know where you are going—there’s very little cell reception in the backcountry.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more comfort for your weekend away, there are lodging facilities available at three areas of the park: Skyland (milepost 41.7), Big Meadows (milepost 51), and Lewis Mountain (milepost 57.5). All three offer many more creature comforts than tent camping, including rustic cabins to more traditional hotel-style rooms, free wi-fi, and dining rooms, depending on which area you choose.</p>

<hr>
<p>Once you are settled in, you can figure out how you are going to spend your time in the park. There is almost an unlimited number of options for hiking and running. Trails range from less than a mile to several dozen miles. One hundred and one miles of the Appalachian Trail also meander through this park making the AT the longest continuous route here. All of these trails are all great <a href=""/shenandoah/hiking"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">for hiking</a>, and many serve as <a href=""/grand-canyon/trail-running"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">challenging trail runs</a>.</p>
<p>The highest point in the park is the 4,051-foot Hawksbill Mountain. The shortest route to the top starts at the Hawksbill Gap parking area between mileposts 45 and 46 off of Skyline Drive. The 1.7-mile round-trip hike on the Lower Hawksbill Trail is steep, but your effort is rewarded by a fantastic view of the entire park. Your quads, however, will feel it on the way down.</p>
<p>Another fun area for hiking is near Loft Mountain in the southern section of the park. If you are looking to get some mileage, try the Browns Gap Trail. It starts across from the parking lot at mile 83 and tackles portions of a fire road and three different trails, including the AT. The 6.5-mile loop has three picturesque waterfalls and is considered to be moderately challenging.</p>
<p>If cycling is more up your alley, then you are in luck. The park is a favorite training ground for road cyclists who want to test themselves on the punishing climbs of Skyline Drive. From north to south, the road ascends 15,000 feet in elevation and travels up 18 categorized climbs. Heading in the opposite direction from south to north, the ride yields about 13,400 feet of elevation gain over 19 rated climbs. Translation: It's very difficult and your legs will hurt.</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep a few things in mind as you set off on your bike:</p>
<p>A compact crank (50-34 gear ratio), or at least a mid-compact crank (52-36) is your best bet because of the elevation gain.<br>The speed limit on Skyline Drive is 35 MPH for cars and bikes. There are some very fast downhill stretches and you'll want to keep your speed under control.<br>Drivers can easily get distracted on the road when they're taking in the scenery and wildlife, so stay alert.<br>A weekend cycling adventure in Shenandoah National Park is best done over two days. If you have someone with you who's not riding, have them keep the car roughly halfway up so you can all stay at one of the lodges. Ride from the start of the road to the lodging on day one, and finish riding the road the next day.</p>
<p>If the aforementioned activities are not your thing, there is still plenty to do along Skyline Drive. Hop in a car and visit each of the 75 designated scenic viewpoints along the road. Bring food and have a picnic at one of them. Or just take a deep breath and smell the fresh, clean mountain air as you admire the valleys and mountains below and in the distance.</p>
<p>That's really what Shenandoah National Park is all about—enjoying nature in its finest form.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">When is trail running not really trail running? In other words, can this increasingly popular activity be so challenging that it becomes less like running and more like hiking?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">If there is such a thing, it likely exists in Shenandoah National Park. And although there are certainly some trails in this stunning, 200,000-acre park that offer a more gentle trail running experience—flowing rollers, minimal rock-hopping—there are others that are sure to test even the most hardcore veterans, with steep ascents, boulder scrambling, and other obstacles that can slow a brisk pace to a 20-minute-mile slog.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">But whatever kind of trail you tackle, you’re all but guaranteed an unforgettable experience, with some of the most stunning vistas in Virginia’s Piedmont region. And, with more than 500 miles of trails within the park (one-fifth of which is the iconic Appalachian Trail), you never have to run the same route twice. But be prepared to walk if necessary, and be sure to choose your shoes carefully: You’ll want a pair that offers good support and a sturdy sole with some grip.</p>

<hr>
<p>The area around Skyland is a popular spot for trail runners. Situated between mileposts 41 and 42, this is also a good rest stop along the 105-mile Skyline Drive that serves as the main road through the park. There is food and lodging here, but the real draw for trail runners are the superb routes.</p>
<p>The Stony Main Trail starts on a gradual incline on a rocky surface, ascending to the summit on a 1.6-mile route. Some sections are steep and you may be forced to walk. If you’re looking to add some hill work to your routine, this is a good choice. Other trails in the Skyland area include Millers Head (1.6 miles), Limberlost Trail (1.3 miles), and Little Stony Man (0.9 miles).</p>
<p>Another good section for trail running is around Big Meadows, which serves as roughly the halfway point between the northern and southern ends of Skyline Drive. The entrance to Big Meadows, which has food, lodging, RV parking, and gas, is around milepost 51.</p>
<p>The Story of the Forest Trail is a 1.8-mile circuit consisting of tree-lined paths and a paved sidewalk that runs alongside a road. It's a nice change of pace from some of the rocky and technical terrain featured throughout the park, with some beautiful views of the meadow across Skyline Drive for which this area is named.</p>
<p>If you want to run a bit longer, try the three-mile Skyland-Big Meadows Horse Trail, which stretches between Big Meadows on the south and the Fishers Gap Overlook on the north.</p>
<p>All of the horse trails within the park are blazed in yellow and most offer a comfortable gravel surface. Translation: less rock- and fallen-tree hopping required.</p>

<p>Skyline Drive starts in Front Royal and continues south for 105 miles until it ends in Waynesboro. At that point, the road becomes the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is similar to Skyline Drive in that it winds through the mountains, except that it's 469 miles long and travels through Virginia and North Carolina. Two crossing roads intersect with Skyline Drive: Thornton Gap (milepost 31.5) and Swift Run Gap (milepost 62.7).</p>

<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>The Tuscarora-Overall Run Falls Trail is strenuous and challenging. - </span><em>Jason Devaney</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There are four entrances to the park: Front Royal at the northern end, Thornton Gap (milepost 31.5), Swift Run Gap (milepost 62.7), and the southern end of Skyline Drive at Rockfish Gap. Not surprisingly, there are great hikes near all four entrances.</p>
<p>A fun hike in the northern section of the park is the six-mile round-trip Tuscarora-Overall Run Falls Trail, which brings you past two waterfalls. The hike starts in the parking lot just past milepost 21 on Skyline Drive. The beginning of it shares a section with the Appalachian Trail (AT) until it eventually branches out on the Tuscarora-Overall Run Falls Trail. As you make your way along the trail, you'll notice the semi-steep downhills that allow you to cruise through parts of the trail. Unfortunately for you, that means you'll have an uphill hike on the way back.</p>
<p>Right before you hit the three-mile point, you'll come across a waterfall that drops nearly 30 feet, but this is just an appetizer. Not far down the trail, the majestic Overall Run Falls will come into view. This 93-foot waterfall is a sight to see, and there's a great viewpoint that looks straight at it from the trail. Be sure to bring your camera.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there are some strenuous parts—think burning calves and lungs—on the trip back to the car. Bring some food and water with you and take it slow.</p>
<p>If you want to see one of the best views in the park, start at the Meadow Spring parking lot (between mileposts 33 and 34) and hike up to Marys Rock. This 2.8-mile, out-and-back route climbs up the steep Meadow Spring Trail and then hooks up with the AT for about a mile. The trail eventually turns left—it’s well-marked so you shouldn’t miss the turn— and has you scrambling up a technical rock graden for about a quarter of a mile. You'd be smart to wear a pair of solid hiking boots for this short hike because of the rocky terrain. Your ankles will thank you later.</p>
<p>The ascent is well worth the lactic acid, however, as you'll be treated to a view that looks north, west, and south over the Shenandoah Valley and Thornton Gap. If you're able, scramble up the rocks and take in the view from the very top of the 3,514-foot mountain. You'll see layers and layers of mountains to the far west, which are part of the George Washington National Forest.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another good hike—and it's a short 1.2-mile circuit—is the rock scramble to the top of Bearfence Rock. Leave your car in the Bearfence Mountain parking area between mileposts 56 and 57, and then follow the trail to the top. There are two breathtaking views, including a 360-degree vista.</p>
<p>Regardless of which trail you decide to tackle, it's essential to keep your eyes in front of you and pick your line because there are rocks everywhere. Small rocks are embedded into the trail surface and larger rocks stick out like ankle-breaking obstacles. Some places even have fallen trees lying across the paths.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is this: Many of the routes borrow real estate from the 2,190-mile AT. So as you're walking along these trails, it’s fun to think about how many others have taken the same steps you're taking. According to the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy, more than 15,000 people have hiked the entire length of the AT. The organization estimates that upwards of 2 million people hike some portion of the trail each year.</p>

The park, which was established in 1935, boasts more than 500 miles of trails, including 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail, that range in difficulty, elevation change, and terrain. In other words, it’s the perfect backdrop for a backpacking trip in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, with westward-facing views showing off the majestic mountain skyline of the George Washington National Forest.</p>
<p>The park is accessible via four entrances; once inside, you can focus on the abundant trails, views, and nature within. The park is downright majestic in the fall, when a riot of changing leaves draws thousands of leaf-peepers to Shenandoah, but whenever you visit, you’re all but guaranteed an unforgettable outdoor adventure.</p>
<h2>Recommended Hikes</h2>
<hr>
<p>Options abound for backpack hikers who want to spend a few days enjoying nature here. A solid two-day trip is in the Whiteoak Canyon Area. Starting in the Crescent Rock Overlook at milepost 44.4, you’ll take the Appalachian Trail and the Salamander Trail to Hawksbill Peak. From there, you hike south, cross Skyline Drive, and tackle a challenging but breathtaking route that passes no less than six waterfalls, the highest of which is 86 feet. Day 1 includes roughly 6.5 miles of hiking; you’ll bed down for the night at campsites on the Whiteoak Canyon Trail.</p>
<p>Day 2 consists of about five-plus miles of hiking the rest of the way up Whiteoak Canyon and shorter sections on the Limberlost Trail and the Crescent Rock Trail. This route gets crowded on the weekends, so plan your trip during the week to enjoy more solitude.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""The Riprap Trail hooks up with two other trails and makes for a great multi-day hike."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/shenandoah-backpacking-02_w6t6sp_480x480.webp?v=1727203884""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>The Riprap Trail hooks up with two other trails and makes for a great multi-day hike. -</span><em><span> </span>Jason Devaney</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Riprap area, located in the southern region of the park, offers some excellent backpacking routes. One circuit, approximately 9.5 miles and ideal for a two-day trip, connects the Riprap and Wildcat trails, with a stretch along the Appalachian Trail and a swimming hole along the way. The route starts at milepost 90 in the Riprap Parking lot, with day 1 starting on the AT before turning into the Riprap Trail. Many backpackers usually do three to five miles during this stretch, which has some steep sections as it negotiates the mountain terrain, although the views make up for it. Day 2 finishes the Riprap Trail (if you didn’t finish it on day 1) and then follows the Wildcat Ridge Trail (2.7 miles) and the Appalachian Trail north (2.8 miles) back to your car.</p>
<h2>Must-Visit Trails</h2>
<hr>
<p>Whether you’re a first-time visitor to Shenandoah or a seasoned veteran, there are several must-do trails worthy of exploring. From presidential history to waterfalls to jaw-dropping views, these trails deliver every time.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/shenandoah-backpacking-03_a7j6lj_480x480.webp?v=1727203952"" alt=""Several small cascades like this one lead up to the 81-foot Lewis Falls."" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Several small cascades like this one lead up to the 81-foot Lewis Falls. - </span><em>Jason Devaney</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Named after a spectacular, 81-foot waterfall, the Lewis Falls Trail is one such highlight. One option to check out these falls is a 3.3-mile circuit route from the amphitheater at Big Meadows to the Lewis Falls observation point; another is a two-mile out-and-back hike to the falls from Skyline Drive. Both routes cross the Appalachian Trail, so you can jump on that and head either north or south and turn a relatively quick hike into a multi-day journey.</p>
<p>Hiking around Old Rag is one of the most epic treks in the park, but it is only recommended for experienced hikers and backpackers. A backcountry camping permit is required to stay overnight, with limited campsite areas because camping above 2,800 feet is prohibited in this area.</p>
<p>Start a hike here from the Old Rag parking area, which is off Route 600, not Skyline Drive.</p>
<p>The Rapidan Camp area features a restored presidential fishing retreat used by former President Herbert Hoover. Built in 1929, the camp has three historic buildings and can be reached by the Mill Prong Trail (between mileposts 52 and 53 on Skyline Drive). It’s a four-mile out-and-back route, while other trails, like the Laurel Prong Trail, intersect along the way. The iconic Appalachian Trail is within easy distance, too, offering options for multi-day hikes here.</p>
<p>Other areas to consider for backpacking trips are the Loft Mountain Area (near milepost 80) and the Blackrock Summit Trail (milepost 85). Both boast stunning views and many other trails cross their paths, making for great two and three-day hiking options.</p>

Weekend adventures in Colorado’s most popular wilderness area require planning in advance, especially if you’re aiming to set up camp at one of the car-camping/RV-friendly campgrounds.

<hr>
<p>Many people come to the park simply to enjoy the mountainous views. This is best done by touring along Trail Ridge Road, the 48-mile, paved road that runs through the park. Even though it tops out at an exposed 12,183 feet it’s not the highest paved road in America (or even in Colorado, the honor for both is claimed by 14,130-foot Mount Evans Road). Nonetheless, there is plenty to see.</p>
<p>A full day can be made of driving from the Beaver Meadows entrance station on the east (Estes Park) side of the park all the way up and over the highest point, down to the Colorado River and then back. Weekend traffic often crawls along the upper reaches of the road, partially due to the expansive views of the park’s highest mountains, and in part due to the unnerving exposure the road presents for some drivers. Never fear, the road is always wider and safer than it may appear!</p>
<p>There are dozens of scenic pull offs along the way and the Alpine Visitor Center near the top of the road offers an opportunity to get out in the open air and hike around on several short trails. A tour of the road is a classic and memorable experience, especially for families, photographers, or those who have never had a chance to soak in the beauty of Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.</p>

<hr>
<p>For many, however, simply seeing the park isn’t enough. They want to immerse themselves in it. There are hundreds of day hiking options, from casual strolls to epic peak bagging. On the less strenuous side, hikes to lakes and waterfalls are popular adventures. One of the best areas to do this is from <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/upload/RMNP-BL-Summer-2015.pdf"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Bear Lake trailhead</a>, a bustling but beautiful trailhead that quickly fills up with parking requiring a (free) shuttle ride.</p>
<p>Bear Lake is literally right at the trailhead, but many other scenic alpine lakes are nearby. Less than 3-mile (one-way) hikes include: Nymph Lake, Cub Lake, Mills Lake, Dream Lake, Fern Lake, and Bierstadt Lake. For a longer day hike from this trailhead, the 10-mile round trip to Sky Pond is a worthy trek.</p>
<p>Glacier Gorge trailhead is on the same road as Bear Lake trailhead (all Glacier Gorge destinations are reachable from the Bear Lake trailhead). One of the best hikes from here is<a href=""http://rockymountainnationalpark.com/things-do/hiking/Jewel-Lake"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""> Jewel Lake/Mills Lake,</a> a 6.2-mile round trip outing. The cirque of peaks from Jewel Lake is impressive, towering over the valley floor, often with plumes of snow whipping from the exposed ridges.</p>
<p>If waterfalls are on your agenda, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/upload/Wild-Basin-Summer-2014.pdf"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Wild Basin</a> is the place to be. On a 7- or 8- mile round-trip adventure, hikers can visit Copeland Falls, Calypso Cascades, and the modest-but-mighty Ouzel Falls. Even though the mileage may seem high, the trail to these waterfalls has low-grade elevation gains and is never too strenuous. More ambitious hikers can continue beyond Ouzel Falls (the last in the trio) to Lion Lakes or the deep basin at Thunder Lake—either destination can be hiked in and out in a full day, around 10-12 miles.</p>
<p>RMNP has 120 backcountry campsites. These require a backcountry permit, a $26 fee, and some planning for reservations, but it is by far the most intimate way to see the park. For more information on these campsites, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/site_details.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">visit the extensive NPS backcountry site</a>. As a general rule, many of the campsites are near lakes or streams and the western trails tend to be less busy than the eastern destinations—unless you’re considering wildlife traffic!</p>

The most popular destinations are often clogged with tourists, which can hinder your physical and mental momentum. Here’s a few select choices that visit some of the more secluded areas of the park but are still easy to access.</p>
<p>One of the very best running trails is the St. Vrain Trail from the <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5373116.pdf"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">St. Vrain Mountain trailhead</a>. Interestingly enough, this trail doesn’t actually begin within park boundaries—you’ll cross over into part territory after you pop out of treeline around three miles in. The bonus here is that you won’t have to pay for park admission, the trailhead parking is free.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Aspen corridor on the St. Vrain Trail."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/rocky-mountain-trail-running-03_hhherf_480x480.webp?v=1727203242""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Aspen corridor on the St. Vrain Trail.  - </span><em>James Dziezynski</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The St. Vrain Trail begins in a beautiful pine and aspen forest and maintains a smooth, gradual grade for the first 10 to 20 minutes of running. After about a mile and half, the trail abruptly begins to contour up a series of switchbacks. The grade gets a bit steeper but nothing too intense, with the exception that you’re now running over 9,000 feet. Just around three miles in, the forest begins to open up to a wide open alpine saddle with incredible views of Copeland Mountain, St. Vrain Mountain, and Meadow Mountain. You’ll also pass into park territory here, where runners have a few options.</p>
<p>Go off trail to the north (right) and work up the 11,632-foot Meadow Mountain or stay left on the St. Vrain Trail. The large, dome of a peak off this path is St. Vrain Mountain at 12,162 feet. There’s no formal trail but it’s easy navigation up grassy slopes to its impressive summit. A round trip out and back to the top is just under nine miles. Finally, you can stay on the trail and drop down into the next basin and eventually, the Buchanan Pass Trail (almost all downhill). It’s about 2.3 miles from the flanks of St. Vrain Mountain to the intersection of the trails.</p>
<p>In the park proper, the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/upload/Wild-Basin-Summer-2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Wild Basin</a> area is an excellent place to get in a tough but peaceful run. Sand Beach Lake trailhead is just after the pay gate (this is a normal, paid access area of the park—$20 per vehicle). On hot summer days, this trail stays under the shade of pine and aspen forests all the way to the lake (4.2 miles one-way). In the autumn, the Sand Beach Lake Trail is paved with gold and red aspen leaves and the cool mountain air is simply divine.</p>
<p>Farther down the road from the Wild Basin entrance is the Wild Basin trailhead. The gem of a run here is along the main trail that starts to Copeland Falls and continues on to Lion Lakes. It’s good mileage to Lion Lakes—14 miles out and back—but the trail is flat for the first three miles and after that, only gradually increases in elevation. For a little more vertical, the 6.8-mile option (one way) to Thunder Lake offers a bit more rocky terrain.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the <a href=""https://www.summitpost.org/longs-peak-trailhead/171483"" target=""_blank"">Longs Peak trailhead</a> is of interest to many runners, though be warned, this is one of the most heavily traveled trails in the park. Car parking is free, but the lot often fills up long before sunrise. Many trail runners opt to get to the trailhead around 9 or 10am and run an out and back to the Boulder Field (about 5.5 miles in). A classic among Colorado runners is to run to the fabled Keyhole (the start of the technical scrambling section up Longs) and back, for a 12.5 mile run. The crowds disperse after the first mile or two and the trail is wide enough to pass in most places. It may be busy but the views of this incredible area are worth it.</p>

With the exception of the wildly popular trails to Longs Peak and Chasm Lake, the crowds thin out dramatically the further along the trail you go. Hikers who make the extra effort to wander away from the paved roads will discover beautiful alpine settings that showcase a less hectic and more wild side of the park.</p>
<p>No other area embodies the pristine wilderness than the terrain accessed out of Wild Basin. A less visited area than the Trail Ridge Road section of the park, Wild Basin’s main access path is the Thunder Lake/Ouzel Falls Trail. Ouzel Falls is a modest but majestic waterfall that sets the stage for the hiking destinations beyond.

<hr>
<p>A fork in the trail splits southwest to Thunder Lake and Boulder Grand Pass. Thunder Lake is tranquil and isolated, ringed by the fading high-alpine forests that give way to the rocky walls of the surrounding peaks, including the snowy saddle that is Boulder Grand Pass. The northern fork gradually opens up to one of RMNP’s best kept secrets: the Lion Lakes. This chain of lakes comes into view as the trail fades to a whisper with the highest pond above treeline.</p>
<p>An excellent loop for strong hikers is continuing on from Lion Lakes to Mount Alice, Tanima Peak, then down Boulder Grand Pass to Thunder Lake. It’s a whopping 18 miles round trip but can be done in a day, thanks to the six miles in and out on the relatively flat and speedy access trail. Even more challenging is a hike to Isolation Peak or to the seldom seen Moomaw Glacier, all out of Wild Basin.</p>
<p>In contrast to Wild Basin’s serene ambiance, the Longs Peak trailhead is a busy, bustling place, but one worth visiting. It’s the one major section of the park that doesn’t require a fee to visit and the namesake 14,255-foot peak is one of Colorado’s most popular hikes. Longs Peaks is a demanding 15-mile round-trip adventure that features exposed scrambling and is an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>Start early if you want to bag the peak—even strong hikers are on the trail at 2am. If you want a more casual day, hiking to Chasm Lake (along the same shared trail for the first four miles) is a nice option, as is just wandering around the boulder fields before the Keyhole, Longs’ infamous notch that grants scrambling access to the main hiking route.</p>
<p>Not all hikes need to end at a summit, as the scenic trails from Bear Lake trailhead and Glacier Gorge can attest to. These are peaceful, moderate outings and many are perfect for families. Bear Lake, Jewel Lake, Nymph Lake, Dream Lake, Cub Lake and Emerald Lake are just a few of the lake options that are excellent for a casual day out. Bear Lake is literally right there at the aptly named Bear Lake trailhead parking lot. The Loch, and Mills Lake are slightly more challenging hikes that are still easily accessed by hikers looking for a casual day out. Never fret, there are still summits to climb for those yearning for big vertical—Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain are both superb, all-day walk-ups accessed from the Bear Lake trailhead.</p>

<p>High off Trail Ridge Road is the slight detour to Old Fall River Road, where hikers can access the Chapin Peak trailhead. Following a well-maintained and easy to navigate Class 2 trail, hikers break treeline at the foot of 12,454-foot Mount Chapin. From there, the high, rolling alpine tundra continues along broad ridgelines to Mount Chiquita (13,069 ft.) and eventually to Ypsilon Mountain (13,154 ft.) These peaks border on the Mummy Range, a sub-range of of the Rocky Mountains that include Fairchild Mountain (13,502 ft.) and Mummy Mountain (13,430 feet).</p>
<p>Finally, for those looking for a hidden side of the park even more remote than Wild Basin, try the East Inlet Trail on the west side of the park. This trail is popular for backcountry backpackers, but also serves well as a day hike destination. Lone Pine Lake, Spirit Lake, and Lake Verna are three of the best destinations. All feature dramatic views of the high peaks along with deep forests. This outpost is an excellent place to seek wildlife beyond the plentiful elk that hang out throughout the park. Black bear, moose, bobcat, porcupine and other critters call this domain home.</p>
<p>For the truly adventurous, a cross park tour from East Inlet over Boulder Grand Pass ending at Wild Basin is one of Colorado’s supreme backpacking adventures, especially in the colorful and cool autumn months.</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 14:39:40 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:24 -0400","true","2024-09-24 14:39:40 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/rocky-mountain-hiking-02_obsiib.jpg?v=1727211908","2048","1536","Hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","40","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hiking In Rocky Mountain National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park.

There are 120 (!) designated backcountry campsites in the park and countless ways to link them together. Backpackers come for the photo opportunities, fishing, peak bagging, or simply to wander into the wilderness and soak in the solitude. Crowds dissolve along trails that plunge into the heart of the park and there are many sections, such as the eastern flanks of the Never Summer Mountains in the northern reaches of the park, that are removed from the busy tourist traffic that descends upon the popular areas every summer.</p>
<p>Note that for any trip to RMNP’s backcountry, you’ll need to register for a permit and pay a $26 fee (for each trip, not per person). You can begin plotting your adventure on the <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/backcntry_guide.htm"" target=""_blank"">National Park’s</a> website, where there will be details on reservations and schedules.

<p>For a true wilderness experience, <a href=""https://www.backpacker.com/trips/rocky-mountain-national-park-mirror-lake/#bp=0/img1"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Mirror Lake</a> is a wonderful place to visit. It’s 6.6 miles one-way (13.2 miles round trip) to this exquisite lake. Surrounded by the towering Mummy Range mountains, the trail is straightforward and well-maintained, with several bridge crossings. The serene pine forest here is home to a lot of the park’s more reclusive wildlife, so bring your camera and your bear bells. If you arrive at the lake on a quiet, windless afternoon, you can reflect upon how this placid alpine lake got its name.</p>
<p>If it’s a grand west-to-east tour you’re looking for, a 2 -3 day trek from the East Inlet Trail over Boulder Grand Pass to the Wild Basin Trailhead is a memorable and challenging adventure. Since this is a point to point, you’ll have to figure out your vehicle drop off/pick up logistics beforehand.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""En route to Boulder Grand Pass with Longs Peaks (center) and Mount Meeker (right) in the background."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/rocky-mountain-backpacking-01_golbcz_480x480.webp?v=1727202855""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>En route to Boulder Grand Pass with Longs Peaks (center) and Mount Meeker (right) in the background.  - James Dziezynski</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The route is excellent in either direction, but this description starts at the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/boulder-co/backpacking-camping/east-inlet-trail-backpacking-rocky-mountain-national-park"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">East Inlet Trailhead</a>. Day one will go 7 - 8 miles to either Lake Verna or Upper East Inlet campsites near Spirit Lake. This trail is also great as an out and back. Because it starts from the less traveled western side of the park, the views here are unique. Many of the well-known mountains take on a different profile from this approach.</p>
<p>Day 2 requires you get off-trail and ascend the slopes above Spirit Lake to Boulder Grand Pass. Peak baggers will have Mount Alice to the north and Tanima Peak to the south as optional summits. Most years, a snowfield persists on the east side of Boulder Grand Pass and there are no established trails down, but the navigation is straightforward though steep (it may be a bit too much for younger kids or casual backpackers). Descend past Lake of Many Winds and eventually to Thunder Lake, where trails to Wild Basin appear. Camp at Thunder Lake or hike out 6.8 miles from the lake. All told, this route is close to 20 miles, depending on how you scale the off-trail portion of Boulder Grand Pass.</p>
<p>For something a little different, why not visit one visit a ghost town right in the park boundaries? <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/upload/107-Dutch-Town-2015-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dutchtown</a> and Lake of Clouds can be found on the far western portion of RMNP at the foot of the rugged, boulder-strewn Never Summer Mountains. Dutchtown was gone in a flash—populated from 1879 to around 1884, then sporadically until its final inhabitants left for good before 1900. Cabin ruins and a few relics of the mining days remain. The town itself—only four cabins-big in its prime—was an outpost for exiles from the more vibrant but equally short-lived <a href=""https://www.americansouthwest.net/colorado/rocky-mountain/lulu-city-colorado-river.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Lulu City</a>. Once the silver ran out, the town was abandoned.</p>
<p>The hike in starts from the Colorado River trailhead via the Red Mountain Trail. It’s a scenic six miles to the lone campsite—so if you reserve this one, you’ll have the place to yourself. There is no trail to Lake of the Clouds but the navigation is easy. Compared to the rolling peaks of the central park, the Never Summer Range seems to float on a river of talus, with hastily chiseled peaks still retaining sharp points and jagged towers. Peakbaggers can aim for the scrappy summits of Mount Cirrus and Howard Mountain from this basin—but they’ll have to work for the top. The rock is often loose, with some exposed scrambling, which is perfect for those looking for a rugged addition to their backpacking trip.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Olympic National Park is huge, covering nearly one million acres of pristine wilderness in the remote northwest corner of Washington State. Considered by many to be three parks in one, visitors who make the trek west from Seattle and the Puget Sound are rewarded with unrivaled beauty around every corner. Glaciated mountains, brilliantly-green rainforests, amazing rivers, and stunning waterfalls, not to mention the most rugged and wild stretch of coast in America await those who long to explore this true and pristine wilderness. While it’s impossible to experience all of Olympic in just one weekend, this guide will give you a good start.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Unlike other parks in the country, most of Olympic National Park is inaccessible to all but backpackers. Olympic’s interior is impossible to reach by car, with only a few destinations giving a glimpse into the natural wonderland deep in the center of the Olympic Peninsula.</p>

<p>To best start your weekend in Olympic, head to the <a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/port-angeles-one-of-the-coolest-towns-in-america/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">city of Port Angeles</a> on the northern flank of the Olympic Peninsula. The north section of Olympic National Park is the most-visited as well as the location of four of the seven crown jewels of the park. Located along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Angeles is the location of the official visitor center for the park and the perfect place to start your trip to the seven jewels of Olympic National Park. Not included in this list is the rarely visited, yet always beautiful, Staircase Region on the Hood Canal side of the park. After stopping by the visitor center and picking up a copy of The Definitive Guidebook to Olympic National Park, head up to Heart O’ the Hills and Hurricane Ridge.</p>
<p>Hurricane Ridge is iconic, giving those who make the 17-mile drive from the Park Headquarters a panoramic view that is unrivaled. The drive from Port Angeles to Hurricane Ridge is ridiculously impressive gaining 5,000 feet before reaching the parking lot at the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. From here, the Olympic interior can be witnessed in all its glory, with the glaciated summit of Mount Olympus finally visible. <a href=""https://outdoor-society.com/olympic-national-parks-hurricane-ridge-is-now-open-24-7/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Numerous hikes branch out in all directions</a>, making this a high alpine wonderland for the entire family. If you have time, hike to Hurricane Hill and witness a panorama that transcends international borders, taking in the sights of Vancouver Island, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the entire Olympic interior. Watch for mountain goats and marmots during the day, while watching stunning sunsets as numerous deer roam along the southern slope.</p>
<p>After experiencing Hurricane Ridge, head west along the famous Highway 101, quickly reaching the Elwha River, where you can access the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/elwha"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Elwha Valley</a>. The Elwha was once the home of two dams which were removed in 2012. Now, the river runs free as it did a century ago and gives visitors a chance to retake the path of one of the original expeditions into the region. The highlights of the Elwha are numerous, ranging from backpacking trips to remote hot springs and rugged mountain peaks. However, the highlight of the Elwha for most is the hike from the Whiskey Bend Trailhead to <a href=""https://outdoor-society.com/twas-the-night-before-christmas-on-the-olympic-peninsula-edition/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Goblins Gate</a> and the Dodger Point Bridge.

The first is the <a tabindex=""0"" href=""http://outdoor-society.com/adventure-running-in-the-dosewallips-valley-of-olympic-national-park/"" target=""_blank"">Dosewallips Trail</a>, on the eastern side of the park. The trail up the Dosewallips is simple to follow and grows ever more beautiful with each passing mile. Much of the trail largely consists of a now washed-out road that is slowly returning to the wilderness. Running next to the Dosewallips River, you pass by Dosewallips Falls before reaching the now remote campground and ranger station. From there, you will want to keep heading upriver to reach the always-gorgeous Dose Forks Bridge. Stopping here and returning gets you a round-trip run of 14 miles with just 1,000 feet of elevation gain.</p>

Set along a historic route that was created for timber extraction during WWI, the Spruce Railroad Trail gives majestic mountain views along the shores of a pristine lake. Besides the ever-increasing views of the lower Olympic Mountains and forested foothills, the trail is capped off with the Devil Punchbowl Bridge, which is also a popular swimming hole in the summer months. The route is mostly flat and can be extended as a full loop of Lake Crescent for those looking for a stunning 22-mile loop unlike anywhere else in America. If you still need more and don’t mind elevation gain, head up to the summit of Mount Storm King or Pyramid Peak to take in the glorious panorama of the lake you just explored.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like running in the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/hoh"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Hoh Rainforest of Olympic National Park</a>.

To say this area is pristine wilderness is an understatement; the Hoh River is timeless, immense, and one of the quietest places on earth. Once you leave the parking area, the mostly-flat trail evades the crowds quickly, leaving you alone with your thoughts in the endless ruggedness of America’s most-famous rainforest. The suggested route is to head to at least the Olympus Ranger Station in the middle of the Hoh wilderness.

In a word, the hiking here is phenomenal. In a few words, it’s quite possibly the best you can find anywhere else on the planet. From impossibly verdant rainforests to rugged and wild coastlines, to the waterfalls and glacial-fed rivers and windswept ridges, the 611 miles of trails in Olympic National Park offer up an endless array of options for hikers of all levels. Here’s what you should know about the hiking scene in one of America’s most gorgeous and diverse national parks.</p>
<h2>The Coast</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Hiking Shi Shi Beach"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-hiking-03_uvahti_480x480.webp?v=1727201240""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Hiking Shi Shi Beach - </span><em>Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Wilderness Coast of Olympic National Park is full of some of the most rugged beaches in America. Olympic has 73 undeveloped, wild, and rugged miles of beaches, all of which can be hiked, and each beach seems more amazing the farther north you go. Tide pools and gigantic mazes of driftwood dominate the shorelines, and just offshore towering sea stacks slowly crumble into the sea. Each spring, 20,000 gray whales swim near the shores, and throughout the year bald eagles circle overhead.</p>
<p>While there are <a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/seven-heavenly-beaches-escapes-in-olympic-national-park/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">seven main beach destinations</a>, three of them are absolute must-sees. For those looking for easy beach access and stunning views of the Pacific, the half-mile trek to Ruby Beach is a can’t-miss classic. Even in the rain, Ruby Beach is a must-see destination. With huge waves crashing against the sea stacks, enormous pieces of driftwood getting tossed around like toothpicks, and winds blasting the bluffs, the coastal region where <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/unveiling-ruby-beach"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Ruby Beach</a> is located is constantly voted the best place to storm watch in the state of Washington.</p>
<p><a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/seven-heavenly-beaches-escapes-in-olympic-national-park/"" target=""_blank"">Second Beach</a>, at LaPush, is also a classic, as it shows off rugged sea stacks slowly eroding from centuries of storms. The highlight for many is the ridge diving into the ocean to the north, dotted with a few trees clinging to life against the power of the Pacific. Over time, the crashing waves found a weakness in the ridge, slowly chipping away until it created a bus-sized hole right near the crashing waves. Right before your eyes, you are watching a sea stack form, seeing the past, present, and future all timelessly converging at once.</p>
<p>However, the ultimate coastal destination is the rugged and remote <a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/seven-heavenly-beaches-escapes-in-olympic-national-park/"" target=""_blank"">Shi Shi Beach and Point of the Arches</a>. This hike, best done during low tide, gives off the most stunning views of sea stacks anywhere in America and is home to sunsets that will forever be etched into your brain.</p>
<h2>The Rainforests</h2>

<hr>
<p>Once you have seen the coast, it is time to explore the lush and dramatic rainforests that rest on the western flanks of the Olympic Mountains. Receiving more than 14 feet of rain each year, the rainforests of Olympic are wet, verdant, and full of huge trees, lush moss, endless ferns, and herds of elk.</p>
<p>One of the most famous hiking destinations in the Olympics is the Hoh Rainforest, and two of its signature trails are the Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature Trail, which can be hiked as a loop and combined for an easy 2-mile stroll. For those looking for more solitude and a true wilderness adventure, take a stroll as far as you can along the 18-mile, one-way <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/hoh"" target=""_blank"">Hoh River Trail,</a> which leads all the way to Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>While the Hoh is a great introduction to the rainforest, the Quinault Rainforest is home to more diverse hiking trails and remote destinations. With stunning hikes like the 5-mile round trip hike to Pony Bridge, and jaw-dropping panoramas from the summit of <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/4-breathtaking-panoramas-on-the-olympic-peninsula"" target=""_blank"">Colonel Bob Peak</a> located above the rainforest, endless wilderness beauty awaits hikers of all levels. Numerous rainforest hikes, with frequent elk sightings can be found just outside the park in Olympic National Forest, as well as plenty of roadside waterfalls and gigantic, record-breaking trees. The rainforest hikes of Olympic are staggeringly gorgeous, and quite simply must be experienced firsthand.</p>
<h2>The Mountains</h2>

<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-hiking-05_vcah7c_480x480.webp?v=1727201459"" alt=""Lake Constance in the summer""></div>

<hr>
<p>On the eastern slopes of the Olympic Mountains, above the Hood Canal, the steepest and most rewarding hikes are awaiting serious hikers in search of adventure.</p>
<p>The main entrance to this region is Staircase, which has a fantastic family-friendly hike called the <a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/the-seven-highlights-of-hiking-olympics-staircase-loop-trail/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Staircase Loop Trail</a>. Weaving through the wilderness, the trail crosses the wild North Fork of the Skokomish River before heading back toward the ranger station. The Staircase Region also has <a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/six-mountains-to-climb-in-olympic-national-parks-staircase-region/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">numerous mountains to climb</a>, including the always-popular and panoramic wonderland of Mount Ellinor. However, if you are looking for a true hiking adventure, take the 22-mile out and back hike to the breathtaking views at Gladys Divide; it’s sensational.</p>
<p>Farther up Hood Canal, those looking for an incredibly steep, yet rewarding hike will not be disappointed with the <a href=""https://outdoor-society.com/closed-olympic-national-parks-spruce-railroad-trail-closed-until-fall-of-2020/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">10 mile out and back trail to Lake Constance</a>. Ridiculously steep for the final two miles, this trail gets you to a shimmering, remote lake with giant mountains looming in the distance. Also in this region is the path to <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/3-stunningly-beautiful-and-secluded-hikes-in-olympic-national-park"" target=""_blank"">Upper Royal Basin</a>, which leads hikers along America’s second steepest river before following a small creek, past a gorgeous lake, and ending at the lunar-like, glaciated base of Mount Deception, the second tallest mountain in the Olympic Range.</p>
<h2>The Northern Regions</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img style=""float: none;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-hiking-04_ong6uj_480x480.webp?v=1727201599"" alt=""Hurricane Ridge""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Hurricane Ridge - </span><em>Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, no hiking trip to Olympic National Park can be complete without exploring the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/ten-adventure-destinations-on-the-northern-olympic-peninsula"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">northern reaches of the park</a>. Considered by many to be home to the most beautiful hiking destinations in Olympic, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-hurricane-ridge.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Hurricane Ridge</a> is just a mile outside the small town of Port Angeles. The best hike to take is the three-mile round trip trek to Hurricane Hill. Giving panoramic views of the Olympic Mountains, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and British Columbia, Canada, this is the iconic family-friendly hike at Hurricane Ridge.</p>
<p>Along Lake Crescent—Washington State’s second deepest lake—no trip to the area is complete without a hike to Devils Punchbowl, Marymere Falls, and the top of <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/mount-storm-king-trail.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Mount Storm King</a>. These three hikes are quintessential to getting a feel for the Lake Crescent region. Farther west from Lake Crescent, the Elwha Region of Olympic National Park gets you up close and personal with views of a majestic river, with highlights including the dramatic view of Goblin’s Gate—a very narrow, picturesque gorge.</p>

<p>Finally, along the northern edge of Olympic National Park, the timeless beauty of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/6-enchanting-waterfalls-around-olympic-national-park"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sol Duc Falls and the Sol Duc River</a> should never be underestimated.

"997371412847","backpacking-in-olympic-national-park-an-insider-s-guide","MERGE","Backpacking in Olympic National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Superfeet","<p>Olympic National Park is often described as three parks in one; in reality, it is even more than that. With glaciated mountains, endless forests, snaking rivers, and some of the best stretches of wilderness coast in the country, the best way to truly get a feel for Olympic is to backpack through the heart of it.</p>
<p>Olympic National Park is 95% wilderness with roughly 1,400 square miles of stunning backcountry. There are 611 miles of trails criss-crossing the park, and while it might be impossible to explore all of them in a lifetime, there are a handful of renowned backpacking destinations that deliver an unforgettable taste of the park.</p>
<p>Here, we offer an overview of some of the can’t-miss backpacking destinations in the park.</p>
<h2>Seven Lakes Basin</h2>
<hr>
<p>Seven Lakes Basin is a 19.3 mile loop trail that is said to be one of the most gorgeous trails in the national park system. Those who get a permit to the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/high-divide-loop.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Seven Lakes Basin</a> region are awarded with drool-inducing sights of stunning mountain panoramas and incredibly pristine alpine lakes. Full of mountain goats, marmots, wildflower-filled meadows, and incredible views of glaciated peaks around the Olympic Mountain Range, this loop is jam-packed with some of Olympic’s finest assets.</p>
<p>Starting at the ever-popular and impressive Sol Duc Falls, the trail heads up along the Sol Duc River, gaining in elevation before spitting out hikers into a lake-filled alpine wonderland. With five killer camping areas around the basin, deciding which spot to pitch your tent is one of the hardest parts. Each lake offers unrivaled beauty, but the highlights are probably the jaw-dropping views at Heart Lake and Lunch Lake. Slightly off the beaten path, Hoh Lake and Deer Lake are also quite spectacular in their own right and may provide a bit more solitude. The Seven Lake Basin Loop is best done during clear summer nights, as this area has some of the darkest skies in the park, which makes for unforgettable and unrivaled stargazing opportunities.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a classic, high alpine experience in Olympic National Park, this is probably the best option. Keep in mind: This region is popular, so make sure you contact Olympic National Park offices well in advance to get your itinerary approved.</p>
<h2>Gladys Divide</h2>
<hr><img alt=""Backpacking Gladys Divide"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-backpacking-04_qgd8du_480x480.webp?v=1727200748"">
<p>Backpacking Gladys Divide <em>- Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For those looking for a more remote hike with less people, head to the southeastern corner of the park and explore Gladys Divide above the North Fork of the Skokomish River. Located near the Staircase Ranger Station, the 20-mile round trip route to <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://outdoor-society.com/gorgeousness-awaits-at-gladys-divide-in-olympic-national-park/"" target=""_blank"">Gladys delivers dense forests, plunging waterfalls, misty rivers</a>, and shimmering twin lakes before emerging at one of the most epic views in the Olympics.</p>
<p>The first 3.5 miles of this trail are flat and scenic, traveling along an old road long since abandoned. The trail then climbs steeply up a ridge for 4 miles, crossing creeks and waterfalls before emerging at Flapjacks Lakes. Flapjack Lakes is a popular backpacking destination, but the true beauty of the region occurs in the next 2.5 miles. The 2.5 miles from Flapjack Lakes are more reminiscent of the Alps than the Olympics, as towering rocky peaks rise on either side. Those looking for an even greater panorama than the view at Gladys Divide (if you can believe it) should head up a boot path at the left of the sign and stand atop Mount Gladys. From here, the glory of the entire Olympic Range unravels in all directions.</p>
<h2>The Enchanted Valley</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: left;"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-backpacking-01_wcblgc_1_480x480.webp?v=1727200911"" alt=""Backpacking the Enchanted Valley"" style=""float: none;"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-style=""float: none;"" data-mce-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-backpacking-01_wcblgc_1_480x480.webp?v=1727200911""></div>
<p>Backpacking the Enchanted Valley <em>- Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For those looking for the quintessential backpacking trip in Olympic, the route to the <a href=""https://outdoor-society.com/rainforest-on-fire-images-and-video-of-the-paradise-fire-in-olympic-national-park/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Enchanted Valley of the Quinault Rainforest is without rival.</a> Starting out along the Quinault River, the trail quickly passes into true wilderness as soon as you cross Pony Bridge just 2.5 miles past the Graves Creek Ranger Station. From here, the path weaves through ancient rainforests, crisscrossing wild streams in the middle of prime black bear and elk country.</p>
<p>After 13.5 miles of hiking from the Graves Creek Campground, the trail once again crosses the Quinault River, this time emptying out into a glorious valley that showcases the stunning river, the surrounding Olympic Mountains, and a 1930s-era chalet that is now used as a backcountry ranger station. Once in the valley, head up to Anderson Glacier, search for gigantic tree specimens, or just sit back and watch the black bears and deer roam about the valley floor in the Land of Enchantment.</p>
<h2>Hoh River Trail</h2>
<hr><hr>
<div style=""text-align: left;"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-backpacking-02_nheg8k_480x480.webp?v=1727201019"" alt=""""></div>
<p>Backpacking the Hoh <em>- Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Hiking the <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/hoh-river-trail.htm"" target=""_blank"">Hoh River Trail to the base of Mount Olympus</a> is yet another iconic hike in Olympic National Park. Mostly flat for the first 12 miles, the trail works its way up the glacier-fed Hoh River, weaving its way through moss-draped old-growth forests and neck-deep groves of ferns.</p>
<p>After Lewis Meadow, the trail climbs 3,000 feet in less than 4 miles to Glacier Meadows Camp, just a short trek to Blue Glacier and the route to climb Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>This hike has it all, from rainforests to high alpine lakes, to glaciers, to the peak of the tallest mountain in the Olympic Range. And it’s all splayed out along one incredibly beautiful and popular trail. While you don’t need to climb Olympus to enjoy the hike, taking a trip to see Blue Glacier should never be skipped. There is a somewhat sketchy section due to a washout, but do not let that deter your adventures. Be aware, the best campsites fill up quickly in the summer when reservations are needed to access the Glacier Meadows Campground.</p>
<h2>Wilderness Coast</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: left;"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-style=""text-align: left;""><img alt=""Backpacking the Olympic’s Wilderness Coast"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/olympic-backpacking-03_tsds85_480x480.webp?v=1727201087"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p>Backpacking the Olympic’s Wilderness Coast <em>- Douglas Scott</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, no backpacking trip to Olympic National Park is complete without a trip along the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness-coast.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">73 miles of Wilderness Coast</a>. While any route you choose will be stunning and memorable, perhaps the best trip you can take is to Point of the Arches and Shi Shi Beach. While this technically can be done as a day trip, backpacking the coast and taking in sunsets on the beach will soothe even the hardest of souls.</p>

<p>Point of the Arches is just 4.3 miles from the Shi Shi Beach Trailhead, but it feels like a million miles from anywhere. As whales swim offshore and eagles circle overhead, there are few things as memorable as taking in the sights of sea stacks and tide pools and mazes of giant driftwood along the wildest stretch of coast in the Lower 48.</p>

<p>For those looking for a longer wilderness coast trip, you can actually traverse the entire Olympic Coast in a mind-blowing 32.8 mile trek from Rialto Beach, near LaPush, to Shi Shi Beach. This is the penultimate experience in rugged coastal hiking and will undoubtedly leave you in awe at the power and majesty of the Pacific Ocean.</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 14:05:32 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:22 -0400","true","2024-09-24 14:05:32 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/olympic-backpacking-01_wcblgc_1.jpg?v=1727211905","2048","1151","Backpacking in Olympic National Park: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","45","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Backpacking In Olympic National Park: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to backpacking in Olympic National Park.

Diverse terrain and elevation to keep you on your toes? Trails that challenge your navigation, problem-solving, and grit? How about adaptability—trails that allow you to lengthen your route if you’re in a particularly kick-ass mood? Well, the Great Smoky Mountains can offer you all this and more.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for the fastest, most convenient way to get a run in out in the mountains, your first stop should be on the Chestnut Top Trail. Located on the Townsend edge of the park, the Chestnut Top trail is a great introduction to Great Smoky National Park trail running. With a diversity of wildlife and more than 50 different blossoming species that put on quite a show come April, you don’t want to miss it.</p>
<p>To start, park in what is often a very crowded lot next to the Townsend Wye swimming hole. It has its fair share of babies, dogs, and “auto-tourists,” but don’t let this fool you into thinking this is an easy trail—you’ll be gaining nearly 1500 feet of elevation over the 8.6-mile round trip. You can also turn this route into a loop by turning left onto the Schoolhouse Gap Trail, continuing onto the Bote Mountain Trail, taking a left on the West Prong and taking Tremont Road (left) and Laurel Creek Road (right) back to the parking lot.</p>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/smoky-mountain-trail-running-03_oe1sok_1_480x480.webp?v=1727200306"" alt=""Rainbow Falls Trail"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span>Rainbow Falls Trail - </span><em>Michael Wifall</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When you’re ready to head deeper into the park, drive up Newfound Gap Road to Clingmans Dome. The northbound trek from the Clingmans Dome parking along the Appalachian Trail to Newfound Gap is a popular one with runners. If you want to add some mileage, you can take the Boulevard Trail to <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/mt-leconte"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Mount LeConte </a>or continue on to <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/charlies-bunion"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Charlies Bunion</a>. If you opt for the former, you’ll also have the option to test your knees’ resilience on a descent down the Rainbow Falls Trail or the Bullhead Trail—assuming you have a second car you can move to those parking lots.</p>
<p>The Old Settlers Trail offers a gentler route with less dramatic elevation changes, and you won’t be weaving around quite as many hikers. But you’ll still need to stay alert due to several stream crossing that can prove challenging during high water. But that’s just part of the fun, right? This trail is 34 miles out-and-back, but you can always work your way up to the full length or have a friend pick you up at the other end.</p>
<p>Also in this area is the Ramsey Cascades Trail, which starts on a level old road bed, but soon veers off into a steeper segment of trail with plenty roots, rocks, water, and other technical aspects. But don’t worry, your scrapes and soggy feet will be rewarded with beautiful Ramsey Cascades cheering you to the finish line—actually, it’s just the halfway point (this one’s an out-and-back too).</p>
<p>On the south side of the park, gravel lovers can take on the Deep Creek Trail. Plenty of runners regularly hit this trail because of its ease and versatility. You can create a flat, easy one-mile run out past Tom Branch Falls and back, or tack on a couple more miles and a little more difficulty by continuing on up to the steeper sections of the trail. There’s also great swimming in this part of the park, if you’re looking to cool off in the warmer months.</p>

<p>And what about running the entire Smoky Mountains section of the Appalachian Trail? The unofficial, unsanctioned Smokies Challenge Adventure Run (nicknamed <a tabindex=""-1"" href=""https://fastestknowntime.proboards.com/thread/128/scar-tn-nc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SCAR</a>, likely an acronym and a warning!) dares runners to cover the 72 miles of the Appalachian Trail that passess through the Smokies in just 24 hours.That’s over 18,000 feet of elevation gain, entirely self supported, with only one potential bailout spot at Newfound Gap. If you feel up to it, we’ll be right there with you (in spirit)!</p>

<p>Important Note: Always remember that the Smokies are wild, and many sections are completely secluded from roadways and any form of civilization. While you might be able to set out at a pretty quick pace into the backcountry, it might take a ranger or a rescue team considerably longer to get to you.</p>

<p>That’s why you always need to be prepared. This means checking weather conditions beforehand (and being prepared for them to change on a dime), knowing the route you’ll be traveling, carrying a map or gps device (no cell signal in the Smokies, sorry), and allowing enough daylight to complete your entire run.

While many a Smoky Mountains trail leads to a beautiful overlook, the winding paths through these peaks are almost entirely immersed in the vibrant green canopy that covers the ancient hillsides. Here you can follow trails covered by elderly trees and skirted by gentle streams, and refresh the mind and spirit with even a short traipse onto one of the park’s “quiet walkways.”</p>
<p>These are trails full of memory, from the homesteading history of Cades Cove to the Civil War scars honored at Gregory Bald. These are trails of challenge, where steep rock scrambles test the resolve of seasoned hikers and force you to search inward for strength. Under the welcoming canopy of the Smokies, you can always discover something new about these old mountains and about yourself.</p>

Whichever way you choose, a high-walled tunnel of mountain laurel will signal your final approach to the tower-crowned summit. Linger here to learn more about the history of the tower, venture out further onto the rocky ridge, or stay for a chat with some AT thru-hikers. If you’re a quick hiker, you can head back down in time for a delicious dinner at Carver’s Applehouse in Cosby, or take a packed dinner up for a sunset picnic on <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/max-patch"" target=""_blank"">Max Patch</a>.</p>

<p>For those searching for a respite from the summer heat, Midnight Hole along the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/big-creek-trail"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">Big Creek Trail</a> offers a chill burst of rejuvenation. These waters run cold year round but are more bearable and even welcome in the hot summer months after the steamy hike up Big Creek. Small children and older adults tend to wade in the shallow waters near the edge, while the young and young-at-heart shed their shoes and shirts while on a sprint to the jumping rocks. On the opposite side of the park, many also dare a swim at <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/abrams-falls-hike"" tabindex=""-1"">Abrams Falls</a>, but waders beware: several have died swimming in these waters.</p>
<p>If you long for a historic hike, set out along Rich Mountain Loop or Elijah Oliver Trail along the once-homesteaded <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/road-running/cades-cove-loop-gsmnp"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">Cades Cove</a>. Primitive churches, cabins, and ancient foundations can be seen scattered around the area—remnants from the area's pioneer days.</p>
<p>You can also hike up Mount LeConte via <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/alum-cave"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">Alum Cave Trail</a> and see LeConte Lodge—built in the 1920’s just before the opening of the park— as well as some of the most stunning sunrise and sunset views. More recent history can be found at Elkmont, where the “discovery” of an abandoned town went viral on youtube.</p>
<p>Some of the best views in the park are from the balds, high treeless clearings covered in grass, laurel, or rhododendron. While many in the Clingmans Dome area won’t ever venture beyond the observation tower, those willing to step off the paved path can follow the Forney Ridge Trail a for less than a mile to reach the highest and perhaps most beautiful bald in the park, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/andrews-bald"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">Andrews Bald</a>. Depending on the time of year, visitors can find blooming rhododendron, flame azalea, and even blueberries! Another stunning view can be captured from Gregory’s Bald, named for Russell Gregory, a respected Cades Cove settler who lived atop the mountain until he was killed by a Confederate soldier in 1864 for supporting the Union.</p>

And if you’ve ever endured the claustrophobia of the Newfound Gap Overlook or been bumper-to-bumper behind a truck bed full of tank-topped tourists on the Cades Cove Loop, then the accusation might seem to have some merit. But luckily, a huge portion of the crowds that that come to the Smokies gather in these small pockets, leaving much of the park’s 814 square miles of rivers, waterfalls, balds, and valleys sparsely trafficked. There are, in fact, huge swaths of the Smokies where you can hike and not see another soul. You just have to dig a little deeper, know where to look, and be willing to spend a few nights under the stars.</p>
<p>Day hikers looking to tackle Mount LeConte in a few hours typically opt for the the quick, steep hike via <a tabindex=""0"" href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/alum-cave"">Alum Cave</a> and often encounter packs of trail chasers with the same idea. But if you have a couple of free days to delve into the backcountry, then you’ll have more options for your visit to one of the park’s most beloved mountains.</p>

<hr>
<p>Your first option is a <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/ladies-night-mt-leconte"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">16-mile loop hike</a> that starts at Rainbow Falls and heads up to LeConte’s summit. Once on top hike back down the Bullhead Trail and stay in the LeConte shelter (not to be confused with LeConte Ledge, which is often booked months or even a year in advance). Your second option is to set out on a misty morning from Newfound Gap and beat the crowds northbound on the Appalachian Trail. From here, you can take a left down the Boulevard Trail for a less trafficked route up Mount LeConte. This route also has the added bonus of seeing the stunning views from the<a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/the-jump-off"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""> Jump Off</a>. Hikers coming from this end of the mountain can also stay at the LeConte Shelter, or double back, stay at the Icewater Spring Shelter, and eat lunch at <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/charlies-bunion"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Charlies Bunion</a> the next day.</p>
<p>If Mount LeConte is not your goal, but climbing the tallest towers and exploring the deepest valleys is, then start your trip at the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/backpacking-camping/big-creek-campground"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Big Creek Campground</a>. From here, you can head to the lookout towers on Mount Cammerer and the less-frequented <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/mt-sterling"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Mount Sterling</a>. These towers, that once served as the first line of defense against forest fires, are now one of the best ways for hikers to get panoramic views in an area where peaks don’t go above treeline.</p>
<p>There are also the makings of a couple great overnights in the Rocky Top/Cades Cove area as well. If you want to see some out-of-the-way waterfalls, consider tackling the “U.” This hike starts at the Middle Prong Trail (at the end of Upper Tremont Road) and passes by Indian Flat Falls and Lynn Camp Prong Falls on the way to its intersection with the Appalachian Trail. Continue back via the Bote Mountain and West Prong trails.</p>

<p>The Middle Cascade of Indian Flat Falls - <em>Ron Jones</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You can also start out west at the Gregory Bald Trail which offers overlooks aplenty. You will get amazing views from Gregory Bald and Spence Field just before descending Anthony Creek Trail to the Cades Cove campground. Both the U and the Gregory Bald Trail hikes can easily incorporate Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountain if you are hoping to check these popular Smokies peaks off your list.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something longer than a weekend trip, you can attempt to hike the entire 72 miles of the Smoky Mountains section of the Appalachian Trail, which travels past Clingmans Dome, Rocky Top/Thunderhead, Charlies Bunion, and several other essential Smoky Mountains destinations. The Benton-McKaye Trail and Mountains-to-Sea Trail are also great longer hikes through the park, and can give you access to the more remote southern end of the park. These one-way hikes can be a little tricky to plan, but even if you don’t have two cars, don’t worry—the park’s shuttle service can help you do one-way overnighters without the parking logistics.</p>

<p>If you want to see some of the most popular destinations without the overwhelming crowds, hike during the winter off-season, when the mountainous horizon is often powdered with snow and the tour buses are long gone. In winter, when Clingmans Dome Road is closed, a trip to the spiral-ramped observation tower requires a long hike (or snowshoe) southbound on the AT, deterring those used to accessing the highest point in the park via a short, paved incline. This is a great opportunity for you if you have a strong resolve to trek through the snow from Newfound Gap to see a deserted Clingmans Dome and nearby Andrew’s Bald.</p>

If you have limited time here, how can you be sure to get the most of it? There are many ways to experience this huge national park, and the trick is to plan ahead and figure out what’s right for you. Here’s what you need to know to master a weekend trip.</p>
<h2>North Rim vs. South Rim</h2>
<hr><img alt=""Scenic view of the Grand Canyon with a person sitting on the edge."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-weekend-guide-05_e4cjbg_480x480.webp?v=1727198823"" data-mce-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-weekend-guide-05_e4cjbg_480x480.webp?v=1727198823"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p><em>- Jesse Weber</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The first thing to know about the Grand Canyon is that it has two sides (and that these sides are really far apart). Obvious, sure, but many people don’t realize the logistical implications. Driving in between takes nearly 5 hours each way. You can choose to split your time between the two, but the best use of a weekend is to choose one or the other, and they are equally spectacular.</p>
<p>More people visit the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/directions_s_rim.htm"">South Rim</a> because it’s closer to a major interstate. It has the main visitor center, classic photo points, and is open year round. <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/directions_n_rim.htm"">North Rim</a> has the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and lesser-known scenery, but is more remote and closed for nearly half the year because of its higher elevations and harsh winters.</p>
<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<hr>
<p>Driving in the park can be a headache because of traffic, pedestrians, and even herds of elk crossing the road. On the South Rim, the solution is to ride the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/bus.htm#CP_JUMP_1993557"">free shuttle bus</a> (don’t worry about missing the elk, there are plenty of them). Park at the Visitor Center or in Grand Canyon Village, then the shuttle can take you almost anywhere. North Rim has fewer roads and no public shuttle, but you can drive the scenic loop that begins from the visitor center.</p>
<p>Bicycles are a great way to get around when the weather is nice. You can enter the park by bicycle, or unload one after driving in. You can also <a href=""https://bikegrandcanyon.com/"">rent bicycles</a> and even take a guided bike tour from South Rim Visitor Center. The free shuttle has bike racks if you want to only pedal one way.</p>
<h2>Day Hiking and Backpacking</h2>
<hr><img alt=""Another scenic view of the Grand Canyon with a person sitting on the edge."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-weekend-guide-05_e4cjbg_480x480.webp?v=1727198823"" data-mce-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-weekend-guide-05_e4cjbg_480x480.webp?v=1727198823"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p>Grand Canyon has trails to accommodate all ages and abilities. Hiking along the rim is accessible and rewarding to anyone, but the only way to experience the depths of the canyon is via steep, rugged trails. North Rim has more options for hiking above the rim, and South Rim has more trails that venture below. Check out the <a href=""#TKTK"">day hiking</a> and <a href=""#TKTK"">overnight backpacking guides</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Mule Trips</h2>
<hr>
<p>Instead of hoofing it by yourself to the bottom of the canyon, you can have a mule team do it for you. Grand Canyon’s famous sure-footed mules can take you along the top or below the rim, even for an overnight stay at Phantom Ranch in the very bottom. These trips are not cheap, however, and fill up fast. Be sure to <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/mule_trips.htm"">book well in advance</a>, especially for the overnight option.</p>
<h2>Indoor Activities</h2>
<hr>
<p>Weather is not always optimal at the Grand Canyon. Summer brings extreme heat and thunderstorms, while winter brings bitter cold and snow storms. Most people visit during the summer, when 100-degree temperatures make it unadvisable to stay outside all day. Don’t ever be reluctant to retreat indoors.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm#CP_JUMP_1878899"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">South Rim Visitor Center</a> has exhibits about geology and history plus all the information you need to fill out your weekend. Also on South Rim is a separate <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/20070524yav_rededication.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">geology museum</a>, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/verkamps.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">pioneer museum</a>, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/art-exhibits.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">art studio</a>, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm#CP_JUMP_2121114"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Pueblo ruins,</a> and the architecturally impressive <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/photosmultimedia/gcid-05-dvwt.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Desert View Watchtower</a>, which provides one of the best canyon vistas anywhere. North Rim has fewer indoor attractions, but does feature an impressive visitor center of its own. You can always enjoy the scenery and probably some wildlife from the comfort of your vehicle.</p>
<h2>Lodging and Dining</h2>
<hr>
<p>Accommodations near Grand Canyon can be scarce, so reserve way ahead of time. South Rim has <a href=""https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">five lodges</a> within the park boundaries. North rim has the glamorous <a href=""https://www.grandcanyonforever.com/"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Grand Canyon Lodge</a>. In-park hotels are pricey, so you may want to look into <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/lodging.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">hotels just outside the boundary</a>.</p>
<p>Heat and A/C are nice, but to really enjoy Northern Arizona’s clear night skies, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/camping.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">camping</a> is the way to go. The South Rim’s Mather Campground has sites specific to RV, car, and bicycle campers. <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/cg-nr.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">North Rim Campground</a> has no hookups but plenty of large sites, and remains shady and cool all through summer. Desert View Campground, on South Rim, is the park’s only overnight stay that is first-come-first served.</p>
<p>The final challenge is finding a place to <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/restaurants.htm"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">eat</a>, because options are limited. South Rim Visitor Center has a “grab and go” cafe, and the Village has a market and deli. There is also a general store at <a href=""https://www.visitgrandcanyon.com/explore-desert-view/trading-post-and-ice-cream"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank"">Desert View.</a> If you are really hungry, check out the menu in one of the lodges, but be prepared for the price. Just outside South Rim, Tusayan has various restaurant options, but the closest real grocery store is in Williams, so consider stocking up when you pass through.</p>

<p>This has been a lot of information crammed in at once, but that’s because the Grand Canyon is so much bigger than most people realize—and not just in terms of geographic scale. The attractions and amenities offered in this national park are numerous and varied to match the millions of tourists that come here from every part of the world.

Photographers come for colors and changing light, backpackers for solitude and sleeping under the stars, and hikers for the challenge of linking rim and river within a day. Runners come to see just how fast they can do it all.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon is a proving ground for athletes. Between the two rims lies a literal gauntlet to be run. Trails here offer the potential for more than two vertical miles of gain within a day—a novelty that is simply not possible most places in the world.</p>
<p>The ultimate feat is “Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim” (R2R2R)—getting from one side, down to the river, up to the opposite side, and back again, in one day. This means more than 40 miles and more than 20,000 feet of up and down.</p>
<p>The R2R2R should not be attempted as your first run in the canyon, and it doesn’t have to be. Running here is not exclusively for the elite. By choosing your route, pacing carefully, and packing accordingly, runners of all abilities can experience “light and fast” trail run. A network of trails makes it possible to tailor distance and terrain, though running here is never easy.</p>

<p>Running along the top avoids the canyon’s typical rigors, but may still feel challenging because of altitude and heat. Rim Trail on South Rim offers spectacular views and is paved for some of the way. North Rim has many trails that stay on top, providing a variety of scenery and distances.</p>
<p>To really run the canyon, though, you have to drop below the rim. Runners usually take the “corridor” trails—South Kaibab, Bright Angel (both South Rim), or North Kaibab (North Rim) because they are wide and well-maintained. To avoid crowds, start earlier than 8 a.m.</p>
<p>The best trail for running is Tonto Trail (South Rim), a single track with rolling hills instead of constant up or down. Getting to it still requires serious elevation change, however, because it is more than halfway down from the rim.</p>
<h2>Trail Etiquette</h2>

<p>Most hikers are on the trail for a once-in-a-lifetime challenge and don’t expect to see people running it. Therefore, it is particularly important to practice proper trail etiquette. As with any other trails, be courteous and yield to uphill traffic. When passing, always give an audible, polite heads up. Many of the dropoffs are dangerous, so you should always be willing to pass hikers on the outside, but carefully move to whichever side they allow you.</p>
<p>Mules always have right of way, no matter what. Getting stuck behind a mule train is a runner’s biggest headache, especially when going downhill. Unfortunately you have no choice but to wait for the mule driver to stop his team and let hikers pass. Always walk past mules, don’t run because if they get startled they may throw their rider.</p>
<h2>How to Prepare</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img alt=""Trail runner at the Grand Canyon"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-trail-running-03_gxdrkz_480x480.webp?v=1727198687"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""></div>
<p>More so in the Grand Canyon than anywhere else, preparation is key. This landscape presents certain physical and logistical difficulties not always encountered elsewhere. Pushing too fast or too far can land you out of help’s reach. A bonk or injury in the Grand Canyon can’t be fixed by hitching a ride, or by using the cell phone to call for help. Even walking it out may prove too difficult if you get in trouble thousands of feet below the rim. Another concern is water and nutrition. Many trails have no water available, and others have water that must be treated. Plan your route based on availability of drinking water (see day hiking for more information on water sources). Despite the feeling of thirst, you should consume lots of salty snacks and energy fuels, because the body constantly loses essential electrolytes to perspiration in the dry air. In general, plan to consume twice as much food and water in the Grand Canyon than you would on a run elsewhere, and this is no joke. Runners have died from dehydration and from hyponatremia (low sodium).</p>
<p>Weather is always a factor for running, and especially so in the extremes of the Grand Canyon. Some days can be oppressively hot at the river while snowing on the rim because of the huge difference in elevation. Depending on the season, you may want to pack layers of clothing. Winter brings ice and summer brings thunderstorms, so always be aware of conditions.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon is becoming a more popular running destination for its beauty and novelty, but its difficulty must never be underestimated. This is a great place to get a workout, but no place to test your limits. Plan carefully, pack accordingly, listen to your body, and you will have the run of your life in the Grand Canyon.</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 13:25:26 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:20 -0400","true","2024-09-24 13:25:26 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/grand-canyon-trail-running-01_qldoly.jpg?v=1727211904","2048","1536","Trail Running in the Grand Canyon: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","50","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trail Running In The Grand Canyon: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to trail running in The Grand Canyon.

<h2>Hiking Along the Rim</h2>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-hiking-05_a43k0u_480x480.webp?v=1727197762"" alt=""Hikers hiking along the rim of the Grand Canyon"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><em>- Jesse Weber</em></div>
<hr>
<p>North Rim has the most options for hikes along the rim, granting phenomenal views without the rigorous descent into the canyon. The easiest is the paved Cape Royal Trail, a 0.6-mile round trip with interpretive signs along the way. It packs wide views of the canyon and the Colorado River into its short distance. Point Imperial Trail overlooks Mt. Hayden’s rock spire and the photogenic Nankoweap Mesa area. It is an easy 4-mile round trip, but it is exposed to summer heat and thunderstorms. There are other rim trails in this north half of the park as well. Pick up a free map at the entrance station to find the route right for you.</p>
<p>The Rim Trail is the South Rim’s only option for staying above the drop off. It is partly paved and partly dirt, and connects many iconic overlooks. Because the trail roughly parallels park roads, you can easily customize your hiking distance by hopping on the free shuttle where it stops.</p>
<h2>Hikes Below the Rim</h2>

<p>Out of the nearly 5 million people who visit Grand Canyon National Park each year, fewer than half venture below the rim. The only way is on foot, which is difficult and can be treacherous. Some pay money to do it by mule, but the free and rewarding route is under your own power.</p>

<p>Numerous trails descend from South Rim into the depths of the canyon. The <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/South_Kaibab_Trail.pdf"">South Kaibab Trail</a> offers the biggest vistas and is the shortest route to the river. <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/Bright_Angel_Trail.pdf"">The Bright Angel Trail</a> is a more comfortable option, however, because it’s less steep, shadier, and has water spigots at places, while South Kaibab has no water until the very bottom.</p>

<p>For an especially scenic journey, drive around to the North Rim and take <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/North_Kaibab_Trail.pdf"">North Kaibab Trail</a>, which pleases with a crisp creek, waterfalls, and rock caves. Though there is drinking water and shade along the way, its length, elevation, and southern exposure make North Kaibab the most difficult of these three, which are known as the “corridor” trails.</p>

<p>All three converge near the confluence of Bright Angel Creek and the Colorado River, a verdant oasis in the bottom of the canyon. Historic Phantom Ranch has cabins and a dining hall (lodging and meals must be <a href=""https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/"">reserved in advance</a>), and Bright Angel Campground has many pleasant tent sites.</p>

<p>Other trails in the park are just as spectacular, but they are unmaintained. This makes them more rugged and challenging.

Few hiking destinations are so coveted as this world wonder—famous for jaw-dropping beauty and notorious for leg-burning trails. Overnighters here aren’t for everyone, but with fitness and a bit of desert hiking experience, you can explore the depths of Grand Canyon in a way few ever do. Yes, it’s intimidating, but this guide will make the journey easier by getting you properly packed and on the trail, which includes working through the national park’s tricky permit system.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Plan</h2>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-backpacking-01_ilxb6k_480x480.webp?v=1727183478"" alt=""Backpacker walking with the Grand Canyon in the background.""></p>
<p>- Jesse Weber</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the most important part, because failure to plan will wreck your trip before it even starts. You should pick a route that is rewarding but feasible. First timers might want to stick to the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/corridor_map.pdf"">corridor trails</a> because they are maintained and easy to follow, yet don’t sacrifice any scenery. The catch is that campsites along these trails can fill up (read about permits below).</p>
<p>Backcountry camps must be arranged in advance, so you need to plan your daily mileage and be able to stick to it. In general, expect to go slower in the Grand Canyon than you would elsewhere. Not only because you’ll be stopping to take in vistas and smell the cactus flowers, but because hiking here is really hard, and that’s no understatement. It’s especially slow going in the summer, when heat takes a major toll. Backpacking here is good year round, but the season makes a big difference, with scorching summers and freezing winters.</p>
<p>Water is scarce any time of year, however, so this is crucial to plan for. Some trails have no water, and others have sources that must be treated before drinking. Your route will dictate how much carrying capacity and which treatment methods are necessary. This information is available from <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/campsite-information.htm"">trail descriptions</a> and backcountry maps.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Secure Your Permit</h2>
<hr>
<p>For the sake of minimizing impact on Grand Canyon’s desert ecology, National Park Service limits the number of campers with a somewhat complicated permit system. You should refer to the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm"">Backcountry Permit</a> web page for complete information, but here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A permit is necessary for anyone camping below the rim, and it specifies trip leader’s name, number in the group, and night-by-night itinerary.</li>
<li>You can reserve a permit up to four months in advance.</li>
<li>You must print and fill out a <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/permit-request.pdf"">request form</a>, and the only way to submit is via mail, fax, or in person—no phone or email.</li>
<li>Once your permit is granted, the cost is $10 plus $8 per person per night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Pack</h2>
<hr>
<div style=""text-align: start;""><img alt=""Two people hiking the Grand Canyon"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/grand-canyon-backpacking-03_wpujfp_480x480.webp?v=1727183933"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p>- Jesse Weber</p>
<hr>
<p>Besides the trek itself, this is the hardest part. You must reconcile weight savings and preparedness—not a simple task. Necessity number one in the canyon is water, followed closely by food, so don’t skimp on either of these. In this desert environment, consuming electrolytes and calories is just as important as drinking water, so don’t forget to eat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another key to preparation is knowing your route backwards and forwards. Time of year, water availability, daily mileage, and campsite amenities determine what you should bring and what you can leave at home. If all your water sources will be potable, save the weight of filters. Some campsites have toilets while others do not. A few even have picnic tables and food boxes. If you plan to stay in more primitive areas, you must bring more materials to pack out waste, critter-proof food, and camp comfortably. Take the time to research trails, campsites, and weather conditions before you go. This will pay off when you know exactly what to bring and, perhaps more importantly, what not to bring.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Be Ready For Anything</h2>
<hr>
<p>Steps 1-3 can go out the window within a matter of minutes. Especially if it is your first time backpacking in the Grand Canyon, expect the unexpected. Thunderstorms pop up often in the summer, and snowstorms in the winter. Water sources may dry up due to freezing or drought. Trails may seem to suddenly disappear. You may get cramps, roll an ankle, or simply find the terrain surprisingly difficult. In the Grand Canyon, which is up to 6,000 feet deep, it’s easy to get in over your head.</p>
<p>This is no reason not to go, however. You just have to understand that hiking here is more difficult than in many other places, so you should be conservative with your goals and wide open with your expectations. Maybe you will show up, throw down, and bust it back to the rim with perfect weather and happy trails, and know you could have handled something harder. Such good fortune just gives you more time to relax and enjoy the depths of the canyon.</p>
<p>Remember that out of the millions of visitors who visit this national park each year, only a few earn the experience of sleeping in seclusion beneath its grand walls. So get on that bucket list and get out there!</p>","","","REPLACE","2024-09-24 09:23:35 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:19 -0400","true","2024-09-24 09:23:35 -0400","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/articles/grand-canyon-backpacking-02_nfaqfc.jpg?v=1727211905","1024","768","Backpacking in the Grand Canyon: An Insider’s Guide","112675193199","national-parks","National Parks","no","","","","2024-09-24 09:08:20 -0400","2024-10-14 11:03:27 -0400","52","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Backpacking In The Grand Canyon: An Insider’s Guide","Check out Superfeet's insider's guide to backpacking in The Grand Canyon.

<h2>The Lost Coast, Sinkyone Wilderness SP</h2>
<p><em>Find yourself among the redwoods and isolated coves of California's wildest shoreline.</em></p>
<p>—Dennis Lewon</p>
<p>The first time I hiked the Lost Coast, I was in college and it was spring, the sky was bright and clear, the irises blooming, and the beach campsites utterly deserted. Perfect conditions, at a perfect time in life. So when I heard other hikers have found the trail too wet, too cold, too hard, or all three, and vowed never to return, I wondered: Is my memory unreliable, corrupted by a golden moment I can't repeat? To find out, I returned again and again over the years, and have experienced the notorious summer fog that erases everything but your buddy a few feet away, and rain so hard that I had to coax my friend to even get out of the car. On my most recent hike there, last July, the poison oak grew so robustly it crossed the trail in places. I remain smitten.</p>
<p>Starting from the Usal trailhead and heading north, the Lost Coast Trail climbs through a grove of skyscraper redwoods infused with fairy-tale light; the red-green glow filters softly through the canopy and settles on emerald ferns that shine as if lit from within. By itself, the half-mile walk through the ancient trees is a life-list experience. Then you eject onto an open bluff, more than a thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean, with a whale-spotting vista that's sure to stall your progress.</p>
<p>Next, you plunge into another redwood grove. Then you'll push through waist-high red and pink and white wildflowers that pop in early summer. And you're still just 30 minutes from the trailhead. Which, in short, is what puts the southern section of the Lost Coast in a class by itself. It's perfect from the very first mile, and never lets up for the next 15 (the dozen miles north from Usal harbor my favorite views and beaches).</p>
<p>True to the trail's name, the coast itself remains alluringly out of reach, protected by a no-go zone of steep cliffs. The rugged terrain--which famously defeated road engineers constructing the Pacific Coast Highway--forces the trail to bounce between fern grottoes and ridge-hugging overlooks. By the time you reach Little Jackass Creek, at mile 7.3, you'll have gained and lost a combined 5,503 feet of elevation. Now follow the creek down to a private beach, with space for one idyllic campsite. Wash the trail sweat off in the icy surf, build a little driftwood fire, and dig your tired feet into the cool sand. You're far from lost.</p>
<p><strong>PERFECT 10</strong> Usal trailhead to Wheeler Beach Camp (mile 11) or continue to the northern trailhead at Orchard Camp (mile 16).</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong><br> From Legget on US 101, go 15 miles west on CA 1 and turn right on Usal Rd. at mile marker 90.91 (warning: the unmarked dirt road may be impassable after heavy rains). Shuttle: Use lostcoastshuttle.com or leave a car at Orchard Camp (see Contact).</p>

<h2>Black Angel Trail, White Mountain National Forest, NH</h2>
<p><em>Sneak into a forgotten corner of the Northeast’s busiest forest.</em></p>
<p>—Larry Garland, as told to Courtney Holden</p>
<p>Like so many hikers, I hike to get away from it all. Unlike most, I get to do it for work, as a cartographer for the Appalachian Mountain Club. In 2005, I became a redliner: My task was to hike every trail—which appear as red lines on our maps—in the Whites. I’m one of only four people to have hiked every one of them, more than 1,400 miles in total.</p>
<p>This forest is crawling with myriad, damn-fine 10-mile stretches, but I say the best in the whole 794,000 acres is the Black Angel Trail. It’s the embodiment of what hiking, at least for me, is all about: isolation and solitude in nature’s undomesticated playground. The Black Angel Trail is best tackled as part of a 16.9-mile figure-eight loop from the Wild River Campground. At 2.6 miles in, you come to a river ford that the guidebook warns may be problematic for “people with short legs or heavy packs”—thankfully, I suffer from neither. Continue in a southwesterly direction, dodging the muddier sections as you follow the river up to its headwaters near the watershed divide and No Ketchum Pond (don’t bother bringing a fishing rod). You’re deep in federally sanctioned backcountry—wilderness with a capital “W” as we call it—so there are no paint blazes on trees to help you find your way. All of this creates a buffer that keeps the crowds away.</p>
<p>You can camp here at Perkin’s Shelter or push on, starting with a 1,500-foot, 2.5-mile climb to Carter Dome. On the Carter-Moriah Range, the nose of Carter Dome looks out to its mightier brother, Mt. Washington, and down on vistas over the Wild River Wilderness. If you’re sick for peace and quiet in the Northeast, what lies next is the prescription for you. Veer east to the Black Angel Trail, and drop off the ridge into a veritable no man’s land.</p>
<p>The 3,100-foot descent down through birch glades inspires a contemplative spirit, so slow down as you stride from the virgin-timber realm of softwood pines and firs, then through sugar maples, birches, beech, and cherry trees. Do yourself a favor and go in early October for the best leaf-peeping of your life; you’ll be alone with your thoughts in an area of the wilderness overlooked by peakbaggers focused on the Presidentials.</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong> Take US 2 to NH 113 S. After 3.5 miles, turn right onto Wild River Rd. After 5.7 miles, park at Wild River Campground. Take the Wild River Trail 7.6 miles to Perkins Notch, head right on Rainbow Trail for 2.5 miles, and opt right onto the Carter-Moriah Trail. In .4 miles, take the Black Angel Trail 7.1 miles to a junction and follow the Basin Trial two miles to the trailhead.</p>

<h2>Timberline Trail, Mt. Hood</h2>
<p><em>Make tracks around Oregon’s gentle giant.</em></p>
<p>—John Harlin</p>
<p>Volcanic dust poofs into the air with each of Adele's footfalls. Step, puff, step, puff...her boots strike the <a href=""http://fs.usda.gov/mthood"" title=""http://fs.usda.gov/mthood"">Timberline Trail</a> near Cooper Spur. Glaciers reflect the bright morning sun high above on Mt. Hood. I watch her steps and the trail’s reaction to them, and my heart beats in time. Puff, thump-thump; puff, thump-thump. I have something I need to say.</p>
<p>We planned this hike to celebrate our 14th anniversary—17th if you count, as we usually do, from when we first kissed. Tonight, we’d have our annual dinner and a room at the Timberline Lodge on the south side of Hood. With each step, I grow more nervous as I work up courage. We’d talked about this before, many times, and always reached the same conclusion: We’d discuss it again later. Only now, I didn’t want an open-ended discussion. I had made up my mind. It was time to change our lives forever. Ten more steps and I’ll say it.</p>
<p>Eight, puff, nine, puff...</p>
<p>“Adele?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“We should have a kid.” Puff, thump-thump. “Now. I think we should start trying tonight.”</p>
<p>Her feet stopped, and my heart raced inside my chest as her boots twisted in the sand until their toes pointed my way. Her face morphed quickly from quizzical to nervous to warm.</p>
<p>“OK,” she smiled.</p>
<p>We turned downhill to walk and talk. Ten more miles before dinner. These are my favorite 10 on the Timberline on any day, but on this one my heart thumped with pure joy. The trail plunged along Gnarl Ridge, across alpine meadows, through scrub, and into subalpine forest. Soon it led into the cold waters of Newton Creek; we could see where it continued up the other bank. We held each other’s arms tightly to brace against the current.</p>
<p>The path then wandered under ski lifts; crested a ridge with views to more</p>
<p>volcanoes in the south; angled down again into the White River’s broad scar of a drainage, victim of a thousand and one floods.</p>
<p>The day’s views stayed familiar—after all, Mt. Hood is our local peak. But I’d never seen the mountain look like this before. Truthfully, I haven’t seen it quite like that again, either.</p>
<p>It’s still 11,240 feet high, covered in snow, with wildflower meadows draping its sprawling shoulders. But now we have 15-year-old Siena, and each year we enjoy pieces of the Timberline. First, she toddled in its dust, then she tumbled in its flowers, and now she strides across its moraines. Each year, it’s the same mountain, but each time we hike it together we experience it differently. Our lives and perspectives flow like a raided alpine stream. Yet always there’s Mt. Hood, like a big snowy fountain that sits in the middle of our lives, and this section of the Timberline to bring us fresh joy.</p>
<p><strong>PERFECT 10</strong> Gnarl Ridge, at junction with Cooper Spur Trail, along the Timberline Trail to the Timberline Lodge</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong></p>
<p>From Portland, take I-84 east to US 26. After 38.9 miles, veer left onto Timberline Rd. and park in six miles.</p>

<h2>Pilgrim Creek Trail, Bridger-Teton National Forest, WY</h2>
<p><em>Trek into the emptiest, most grizzly-packed meadows, all within sight of the Grand Teton.</em></p>
<p>—Tracy Ross</p>
<p>As a freshman in college, I found enlightenment in the faces of a trail crew on a Student Conservation Association flyer. I could see it in their tired, happy expressions: Trail crews had the summer job thing figured out.</p>
<p>So in the spring of 1991, I signed up to work on a crew in the Buffalo Ranger District of the <a href=""http://fs.usda.gov/btn"" title=""http://fs.usda.gov/btn"">Teton Wilderness</a>, on the southeastern boundary of Yellowstone National Park. My home for the summer was the Pilgrim Creek Valley, which fans between Wildcat Ridge and Bobcat Ridge and throbs with one of the densest grizzly populations in the West. Back then, the wilderness still smarted from the 1988 wildfires that burned 794,000 acres. But the entire place coursed with water, and lush pocket meadows thrived amid swaths of charred timber. Now the forest is recovered, with oxbowed streams and groves of flickering aspens. The hike in from the Pilgrim Creek trailhead to Wildcat Peak (where we worked) is arduous. You cross Pilgrim Creek 15 times in the first three miles, before diving into a neck-high willowed jungle. Then you pitch up a steep, sun-baked hillside, then back down into the willows for another 2.5 miles. When you reach the first creek you can cross without wading, you’re nearing the Wildcat Peak junction. Go north, climbing 1,000 feet over 3.5 miles to a wide divide separating the Rodent Creek drainage and Wildcat Peak. Here, the trail peters out, but keep a bearing on Wildcat’s summit and bushwack toward it, picking up the Wildcat Peak Trail .5 mile from the top.</p>
<p>Rewards? Absolutely. Dead ahead is the supremely toothy Grand Teton, snapping at the clouds. Look back, and see the 10-mile trail that turned me into a lifelong wilderness lover. We camped in meadows exploding with blue columbine, Indian paintbrush, and purple monkshood. We saw no other footprints, no fire rings, no tent sites—a backpacker’s Eden. We measured our hands against countless grizzly tracks with claw marks the lengths of our fingers—and I cycled from screaming with fear at unknown sounds to popping the safety on my bear spray to singing with joy after a solo encounter with one big female. According to the Hiking Wyoming guidebook, even the personnel at the Blackrock Ranger Station call Pilgrim Creek a primitive area within the wilderness, and few know what’s back there.</p>
<p>I, however, grew to know exactly what was back there. For 27 days over three nine-day hitches, we crosscut and chopped a six-mile tread into Wildcat Peak. The work beat me down and built me up, so that by the end of the summer, when I looked in the mirror, I saw the same tired-but-happy expression as the kids on the SCA flyer.</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong></p>
<p>From Jackson, take US 191 37.6 miles to Pilgrim Creek Rd. Turn right, and reach the trailhead in 2.1 miles.</p>

<h2>Skyline Trail, Jasper National Park, Alberta</h2>
<p><em>Go to hiker heaven on Canada’s finest high-country path.</em></p>
<p>—Jonathan Dorn</p>
<p>Little Shovel Pass made me a backpacker. Not the occasional-weekend- in-the-woods type, but the guzzled-the-Kool-Aid-and-asked-for-a-bigger-cup variety who daydreams in meetings and haunts the discount racks at REI and who, in 1997, accepted a 25-percent pay cut—with a baby on the way—to take an assistant editor job at this magazine.</p>
<p>I’d hiked plenty of miles before tackling <a href=""http://pc.gc.na"" title=""http://pc.gc.na"">Jasper’s Skyline Trail</a>. With my wife, I’d explored New England’s forests, bumped into bears in the Olympics, and sweated out sections of the Appalachian Trail. But the panorama that unfolded at 7,347 feet atop the switchbacks of Little Shovel Pass—and the way-above-treeline views that slackened our jaws all the way to Centre Lakes—were a eureka moment. Before, I’d seen backpacking as a pleasant, wallet-friendly escape from the rat race. After hiking that 10.8-mile stretch—and realizing just how soul-stirring a grand landscape can be—the pursuit of mountain scenery became a way of life.</p>
<p>The Skyline today has tight quotas— the price of fame and a fragile alpine environment—but it rivals a Grand Canyon rafting permit in worth-the-wait payoff. Tracing ridges strewn with cinquefoil, pulsatilla, and lupine, the 27.6-mile Maligne Range traverse dips into fragrant spruce and lodgepole forest haunted by caribou and black bears for a few miles at start and finish, and at five backcountry campsites.</p>
<p>Smack in the middle—on those 10.8 miles—you’ll ramble across the most sustained stretch of tundra this side of Denali, serenaded all the way by pikas and marmots. Watch for bear activity; we saw a grizzly-excavated hole that looked like the work of a backhoe.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes to the horizon, too: From Little Shovel Pass to the Snowbowl to Shovel Pass to The Notch to Amber Mountain’s descent to Centre Lakes, the ever-improving vistas take in everything that draws photographers to the Canadian Rockies. Maligne Lake’s glacier-blue waters—so brilliantly azure they transcend every cliché. Thousands of acres of icefields flowing through notches in the massifs that tower above the Athabasca Valley to the west. The shark-toothed Queen Elizabeth Ranges to the east. And—from The Notch—the hulking giants of Mts. Edith Cavell (11,033 feet) and Robson (at 12,927 feet, British Columbia’s highest peak).</p>
<p>Whatever you do, budget three days for the Skyline. The middle might be the slowest 10 miles you ever hike.</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong> Allot 3-4 days so you can linger up high. Reserve campsites at least three months ahead. Leave a car at the Signal Mountain trailhead and hitchhike or shuttle to your start at Maligne Lake’s north shore.</p>

<h2>The Jewels Route, Grand Canyon NP</h2>
<p><em>Time one of Arizona’s trickiest passages just right, and you’ll mosey from one idyllic, fern-lined grotto to the next. </em></p>
<p>—Annette McGivney</p>
<p>I am down on my knees pumping from a silty puddle, praying I can get one lousy liter—we’ll need that and more to reach what I’ve heard is the best 10 miles in the entire Grand. The previous night my friend, Jane, and I made a waterless camp at the junction of the South Bass and West Tonto Trails, five miles from the South Bass trailhead. We planned, or more accurately, hoped, to top off here in Serpentine Canyon.</p>
<p>Located in the remote western end of the park and snaking into the deep side canyons of the Tonto Plateau, the Jewels Route is, in total, a 48-mile prize I’d been lusting after for years. These inaccessible spots—each named for a precious gem (Ruby, Turquoise, Sapphire, Agate)—are legendary for their seasonal grottoes and solitude, even though the Park Service does its best to discourage visitors. “There are no permanent springs,” warns the NPS website. “Only unreliable, unpredictable seasonal trickles.” Plus, there are no bailouts, prompting the park to dub the stretch from South Bass to Boucher Trail the most difficult section of the trans-canyon trail system.</p>
<p>At least 10 hikers have died here in the last 50 years by making the same mistake we might be. But we roll the dice—seems a reasonable gamble since we are here after a very wet winter. So with three liters between us, we clamber up the trailless scree slope of Serpentine and search for a cairn on the blinding-bright expanse of the Tonto.</p>
<p>Our boots crunch on a fine pavement of gray-green Bright Angel shale as we weave our way through a sea of blackbrush. The hulking orange Havasupai Point rises against the South Rim while the distant white spine of the Sagitarius Ridge defines the North Rim. Perched halfway between the top of the rim and the river, the Tonto Plateau is a balcony with best-seat-in-the-house views of the canyon. Periodically, we venture to the edge and peer 2,000 feet straight down to the blue-green Colorado.</p>
<p>We arrive at the lip of Ruby Canyon with barely a half-liter. The sun is unrelenting, and my head throbs. We look into the dark, seemingly bottomless drainage. We hear a pattering, like light rockfall, echoing off the canyon walls. Sheep? We cock our heads: water gurgling over slickrock!</p>
<p>Our timing is perfect; the seasonal springs in Ruby are ripe with snowmelt and feeding a lush, riparian oasis. A string of clear pools glint in the sunlight. Damselflies hover and zag. Bright green ferns, moss, and monkey flower pad the canyon walls.</p>
<p>The next day, after lounging in Ruby all morning, we confidently march across the parched Tonto for 5.8 miles to Turquoise Canyon, our next camp, where another perfect oasis awaits. You can continue on the Tonto to Hermit trailhead or turn back and just bag these 10 miles. Or stay another day. No matter what, you win.</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong> Access the Jewels Route via the South Bass Trail (high clearance, 4WD vehicle required) on the west or from the Hermit and Boucher Trails on the east.</p>
<p><strong>SEASON</strong> The only reliable water is Boucher Creek; seasonal flows run in Ruby, Turquoise, Sapphire, and Slate. Best bet for water and reasonable temperatures: February-April.</p>

<h2>Mt. Eielson, Denali National Park</h2>
<p><em>Get guaranteed mammoth wilderness in America’s wildest national park.</em></p>
<p>—Gus Axelson</p>
<p>I took one step into the backcountry and felt like I had been set free from a cage. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy my first year as a dad, but I needed to reconnect with the man I was before my nights were sleepless, lullaby-infused grudge matches. My wife knew it, too, so she sent me to Denali National Park, with her brother, Brett.</p>
<p>My timeline was naturally tight: only a few days to get my fix. So I asked a park ranger for the quickest route to badass country, and he drew up a 10-mile horseshoe crossing Gorge Creek and angling up Sunrise Creek to the Sunrise Glacier, where we’d pick our way through to a pass and then return via Green Dome to Thorofare Pass.</p>
<p>From the Eielson Visitor Center, we picked our way southwest down a steep ridge toward Gorge Creek. Minutes into the trip, I nearly stepped in a pile of soapberry-filled bear scat the size of horse manure. Bingo—instant wilderness on a larger scale than I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>At about mile three, we forded a quarter-mile-wide braid of the Thorofare River. Two miles later, I stood beneath a 20-foot-tall wall of blue ice, a dark maw at its base where meltwater surged into Sunrise Creek. We camped upvalley, hemmed in by rock and ice and 7,000-foot peaks.</p>
<p>The next day, the morning sun lit our path: a steep 1,000- foot ridge we’d need to climb to find the pass. Halfway up, rubble trundled from above. A baseball-size rock hit my ankle. Then a volleyball-like rock careened past, exploding upon impact, right where we’d camped. I’d asked for wild, and got it. New priority: making it home safely to my son. We retreated and camped in a small side valley.</p>
<p>The next morning, I got up early to cook breakfast. As I mixed pancake batter, I noticed a boulder in the willows. Then the boulder moved. Bear! We yelled and waved. I was dusted with mix, a human Krispy Kreme. Finally, she turned slowly like a freighter and plodded away.</p>
<p>So when you need a big dose of badass, come to Denali. Maybe you’ll score a permit for Sunrise Creek, maybe not. But it doesn’t matter: Any 10 miles here will do.</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong> Take the park bus to Eielson Visitor Center, then hop off and hike south. Plan on two or three days, minimum.</p>

<h2>Titcomb Basin Trail, Wind River Range</h2>
<p><em>Head to Wyoming to trek beneath North America’s most beautiful alpine ridge.</em></p>
<p>—Mark Jenkins</p>
<p>MAYBE I SHOULDN’T ADMIT THIS, but … I don’t like trees. After hiking a few fabled sections of the Appalachian Trail and not once getting a decent panorama—just buggy, in-your-face leaves—I gave up green tunnels. Give me rock, ice, and skies as big and fickle as my imagination—brilliant blue in the morning, billowing black by afternoon.</p>
<p>If you want to see earth like this, buck naked but for the skimpiest bikini of alpine flowers, there’s no better place than the Titcomb Basin Trail in the Wind River Range of north-central Wyoming. But you’re going to have to pay for it. It’s a 12-mile slog uphill to reach Titcomb Basin. Starting at the 8,800-foot Elkhart Park trailhead just above Fremont Lake on the west side of the range, you march through scraggly pine forests and humpy rock outcrops for 11 miles to reach the south end of Island Lake, hook onto the Indian Pass Trail for one mile, then camp at any of the three major Titcomb Lakes. I’ve skied it and hiked it and postholed it, and it’s a bloody long day any way you split it. But once you’re there—as long as you’ve had the good sense to go before or after July, when the hypertrophic mosquitoes plunder the place—the 10,500-foot Titcomb Basin is peerless.</p>
<p>Titcomb Basin (pronounced tit-come and named after brothers Charles and Harold, who explored the area in 1901) is a classic U-shaped, glacierbulldozed valley. Hiking north from the southernmost Titcomb Lake, you pass through teal-green tundra with one of the most stunning ridge crests in the United States high above you. I’ve hiked trails from Tibet to Timbuktu and found nothing more gorgeous. Fremont Peak, with its multiple faces and gendarmes, is a Picasso of an attractive but dangerous woman; then Mt. Sacagawea, with her long, dark, sadly beautiful face; then the punk-rock coiffure of Mt. Helen. To the west are the Titcomb Needles, the Great Needle, The Buttress. After four miles, the official trail ends and you’re on your own. The balance of your 10 miles comes in above-treeline, off-trail striding and scrambling that will spoil you forever. Hop boulders and skip through flowering meadows for a few more miles until you find yourself encircled by granite and glaciers, an orgy of mountains. Now climb one of the peaks. Doesn’t matter whether it’s a technical ascent or a hike. You’ll get the view of a lifetime. What’s more perfect than that?</p>

<h2>Grayson Highlands State Park, VA</h2>
<p><em>Score big rewards for little effort.</em></p>
<p>–Jennifer Pharr Davis, as told to Ellie Levitt</p>
<p>In six years of hiking, including treks on six continents and speed records on the Long and Appalachian Trails, I’ve seen my share of jawdropping vistas. But when I want a soul-satisfying hike I can count on year in, year out, I always return to this 10-miler in Virginia’s uplands.</p>
<p>It has a sky big enough to rival any in Montana, a heavenly blue that arcs over an open grassland with rocky outcroppings laced with rhododendrons in June. This loop combines creekside rambling, top-of-a-grassy-world views, trailside waterfalls, rhododendron tunnels, blueberry patches, and wild ponies. Step for step, it’s the most rewarding place I’ve ever been.</p>
<p>You could exhaust a memory card by mile six, where a sidehike leads to to 20-foot Cabin Creek Falls. Take your time—it’s just four miles back to the trailhead, and it’s best hiked at sunset.</p>

<h2>Mt. Whitney, CA</h2>
<p><em>Experience the highest point in the Lower 48 through different eyes.</em></p>
<p>—Trevor Thomas, as told to Casey Lyons</p>
<p>NO BLIND PERSON HAD STOOD ON TOP OF MT. WHITNEY BEFORE. EVER. I planned my PCT thru-hike so my two partners and I would be there on June 27, Helen Keller’s birthday (we made better time and went through six days early).</p>
<p>We wanted to start from Guitar Lake, but we heard that’s where the snowline was and we didn’t want to sleep on ice. So we began at a camp a mile past the Crabtree Ranger Station, following the John Muir Trail for five miles and 3,700 vertical feet to the summit—and the same back down.</p>
<p>This isn’t the normal summit slog from <a href=""http://nps.gov/seki"" title=""http://nps.gov/seki"">Whitney Portal</a>. We would climb the peak on the backside’s deep wilderness, and rise steeply above treeline and the half-dozen tarns that pool below this scree-laced tower. The guidebooks all rave about the scenery—a great stretch of serrated, gray-brown peaks linked together like teeth on a giant chain saw—but I experience it in a different way.</p>
<p>When I hike, I navigate by passive echolocation, like a bat, listening to the sounds I make come back to me. Whether it’s us talking or rocks tumbling nearby, it gives me a signature, and I have a basic idea of what my surroundings will be like—whether it’s open or there’s a cliff. Normally, I tune in on the footfalls of the hiker in front of me and put my foot exactly where he did. But when we got to Guitar Lake, we hit snow, and in such an open bowl, the sound carries. I could tell it was huge, but it was hard to judge exactly where to step.</p>
<p>Halfway up the face, the slope steepened to 40 degrees and I knew it. My feet are so sensitive now that I can feel the paint lines on the sides of the roads through my boots, and I know when the snowpack is unstable. It was dicey, but I took it slowly until the slope flattened over the last cornice.</p>
<p>The sound was incredible. It was like a vacuum, and I knew there was nothing above or beside me. Sheer openness. People ask me: Why climb if you can’t see what’s there? I can’t see the view, but I can feel it. I use my other senses to take in a mountaintop. I think of the smells, the wind, the sun on my face. That summit is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever felt—and my sighted partners agree.</p>
<p><strong>PERFECT 10</strong> John Muir Trail from Crabtree Ranger Station to Mt. Whitney</p>
<p><strong>DO IT</strong> From Independence, take Onion Valley Rd. to the trailhead and hike west 4.8 miles over Kearsage Pass to the PCT. Then trek 19.6 miles to the Crabtree Ranger Station.</p>

We’ll work on new means of appeasing the gods. (Do they want us to burn our old skis or make shot skis out of them? Will try both.) But in the meantime, we can lace up our trail shoes and make the best of the dry conditions. A little cross-training never hurt anyone, after all.</picture>
<div>
<p>Indeed, if we could stop lamenting the lack of snow long enough to acknowledge the dry winter trails in the lower-elevation Wasatch, we’d notice it’s actually pretty prime running conditions. Temperatures are cool and mild, so running in tights and a light fleece works fine. You don’t need full-on winter running shoes; your normal ones will do nicely. Nix the gloves and beanie too. Your water needs will be a lighter than in the summer heat, so you can either run without it or carry just a small amount in a hand-held squeeze bottle. The scenery is stark and sparsely beautiful. And there are very few, if any, mountain bikers to share the singletrack with.</p>
<p>In other words, early-season running conditions exist. And, actually, they’re awesome.</p>
<p>If you care to take advantage, we’re lucky enough to be surrounded by suitable early-spring trails. Here are just a few notable options for trail running in Salt Lake City when the powder plays hard to get.</p>
<h2>Swaner Nature Preserve</h2>
<p> This trail network is exceptionally handy for runners from both Salt Lake and Park City: It offers miles and miles of flat, immaculately maintained trails with lovely views of the surrounding hills. Park at the Redstone Center in Kimball Junction right off I-80, lace up your shoes, and link up with <a href=""http://basinrecreation.org/winter_trails.html#top"">this trail system</a> . Most of the trails are dirt or woodchip-covered and encircle a gorgeous nature preserve in the middle of the natural basin at Kimball Junction. This basin is carpeted with grassland and winding streams in the summer; in the winter it sits silently waiting for spring to bring it back to life.</p>
<p>The mellow, flat nature of this trail system makes it perfect for working on your pacing and breathing technique without hilly variables thrown into the mix.</p>
<hr>
<div></div>
<h2>Glenwild Trail System</h2>
<p>Glenwild is a network of zig-zagging trails up the hill directly north of I-80 at Kimball Junction. This means a 20-minute drive up Parley’s Canyon is necessary from Salt Lake, but the trail offers clean air and lovely views of all three Park City ski resorts. Worth it? Absolutely. <a href=""http://basinrecreation.org/userfiles/image/Trails/2013/Glenwild-2013.png"">The handy map at the trailhead</a> on Glenwild Drive gives you the down-low on your route options. All the trails eventually interconnect and intersect repeatedly, so you can add loops or choose a more direct route if you prefer a shorter distance.</p>
<p>If you choose the trail paralleling the stream going east, you get a good workout on the switchbacks that work their way up several hundred feet of elevation before diverting westward to join the rest of the trail system. If you choose to go west along the stream from your car, you’ll get a gentler, more ambling ascent.</p>
<h2>Grandeur Peak</h2>
<p>Accessed easily from the north end of Wasatch Boulevard, the Grandeur trail rises a few thousand feet above the valley. Since this majestic pinnacle faces directly west, it sees plenty of sunshine and <a href=""http://climb-utah.com/WM/Maps/GrandeurMap.JPG"">the trails on Grandeur’s front side</a> are dry before most other trails are.</p>
<p>Grandeur is steep—very very steep. In fact, most runners can only run the gentler first mile or so from the trailhead. Soon, a sharp turnoff ascends directly up the hillside. This is your big chance for a free Stairmaster workout with sweeping views of the city. It’s an epic quad-driven undertaking that challenges your lung capacity; at best, you’ll keep a brisk power-walking pace for most of it. But on the downhill, feel free to cut loose and plunk your way back down to the car in a fraction of the time it took you to go up. A small grassy area adjacent to the parking lot is perfect for stretching your weary muscles.</p>
<p>This trail network is exceptionally handy for runners from both Salt Lake and Park City: It offers miles and miles of flat, immaculately maintained trails with lovely views of the surrounding hills.

<p>The mellow, flat nature of this trail system makes it perfect for working on your pacing and breathing technique without hilly variables thrown into the mix.</p>
<h2>Corner Canyon</h2>
<p>At the far southern end of Salt Lake valley, Corner Canyon encompasses <a href=""http://www.cornercanyontrails.com/trail-maps/corner-canyon-regional-map/"">a whole network of trails</a> on Draper’s hillside at the base of Lone Peak. This trail is shared with bikers and horseback riders, and in the summer, its popularity shows. But in early spring, when most people haven’t yet dusted off their mountain bikes, it’s quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p>Park at the Lynn Ballard Ballpark in Draper; it’s one good entry point to the full trail network. Some loop sections are single-track, while other sections, such as the Upper Corner Canyon Road, are a wider dirt road.</p>
<h2>Dry Creek</h2>
<p>For those coming from the far northern end of Salt Lake, this is <a href=""http://www.bonnevilleshorelinetrail.org/saltlaketoparleys/saltlaketoparleys.html"">where Bonneville Shoreline starts rising</a> above its hillside traverse above the University of Utah and rides the ridgeline above Federal Heights to City Creek. This is an ideal trail for runners because you get your uphill workout out of the way during the first mile and a half. At the top of that first big climb, a dandy view stretching from Mt. Olympus to downtown Salt Lake awaits. After that, it’s minimal ups and downs.</p>
<p>Park at the Jewish Community Center and follow the trail heading northeast up Dry Creek Canyon. While this is a lovely run, keep in mind that this trail is narrow single-track and is shared between runners and mountain bikers. Approach blind curves with caution, and keep those headphones turned down low.</p>
<h2>Sugarhouse Park</h2>
<p>This charming park has been at the center of Salt Lake’s landscape and culture for a very long time. At the heart of Sugarhouse, you can get a hilly trail run—and with Mount Olympus providing a stunning backdrop, you don’t have to leave town for primo views.</p>
<p>Pick any parking spot and link up with the soft dirt path encircling the park. This trail is just shy of two miles long, so you can add more laps as desired. You’ll bob up and down in elevation during each lap, which adds interest and keeps your calves and quads at full attention.</p>
<p>Good luck out there, and don’t be afraid to get a little muddy while the snow gods consider their next move.</p>

<p>You have a few hours, or maybe even a full day, and you're craving an escape from the city for some trail time. With more than 50 state parks and recreational areas around the Bay Area, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to reach a trailhead within an hour of making your decision. Problem is, the options can easily become overwhelming, with towering redwoods, waterfalls, coastal overlooks, beach access, and challenging peaks to choose from.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there: Long after you planned on hitting the road, you find yourself on your device still reading trail reviews, precious hours of sunshine dwindling as you try to decide on the perfect hike. Here, we’ve done the legwork for you—7 of the best day hikes in San Francisco, from Marin to the East Bay to and farther south in the Peninsula—all within about an hour's drive of the city.</p>
<p><strong>1. MATT DAVIS LOOP</strong></p>

<p>On the western slopes of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/tmount-tamalpais-101-an-adventurers-guide-to-exploring-the-beloved-peak"">Mount Tamalpais State Park</a> , the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/san-francisco-ca/trail-running/matt-davis-trail"">Matt Davis Trail</a> winds through a mossy forest of live oaks and redwoods, revealing sweeping views of rolling hillsides and beyond. Descending from the Pantoll Ranger Station, the trail joins the Dipsea Trail near Stinson Beach, which you can follow to the Steep Ravine Trail for a stunning loop. As it climbs back to Pantoll, the Steep Ravine Trail follows Redwood Creek as it tumbles down the hillside toward the coast, and you will appreciate the soft shade of the redwoods as you climb almost 1,500 feet back to the trailhead.</p>
<p>The loop totals about 7.5 miles, making it a great half- or full-day option. The 45-minute drive is also a highlight—the views from the city can rival those from the trail in some places, though traffic can back up on sunny weekends.</p>
<p><strong>2. COAST TRAIL TO ALAMERE FALLS</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--xjrkMRws--/t_rr_large_traditional/yuyl9rffz1oodm2cycv8.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Alamere Falls tumbles onto the beach in Point Reyes. <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/livenature/5374239461/in/photolist-9bUoa4-9bUnGK-2h6eQn-kcBfuD-dVE6cf-3yVjgS-668Ze4-4Eksvo-669152-7J4Uwa-7QTsSf-7QTn8s-dVE86S-7EhgVy-9Z7CCn-7QToxh-66dcvw-6n7GtN-dVEdSW-7EdkMF-7EdmSz-3goPb-miso4-misLy-mismN-misjX-6bdJuS-86eYdf-7QPVEX-7Edq1e-7Edhdx-4MCiMw-4BUGw6-3eH3U-cLXW1-3goNM-eW9aXt-4My8Cr-4BYZN9-5HzFWJ-hwg6w-4My9sg-boXPJF-4My9En-4MCitS-AizTS-4My8Ux-66deAJ-6Kx6iU-hwg9f"">Franco Folini</a></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>One of only two “tide falls” in the state, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/san-francisco-ca/hiking/alamere-falls"">Alamere Falls</a> tumbles 40 feet from from the beach bluffs directly onto the sand before immediately joining the Pacific. From the Palomarin Trailhead, hike the winding Coast Trail for four miles, passing by scenic Bass Lake. When you reach the cutoff for the falls, the trail becomes steep, descending alongside the upper falls over loose rock and dirt. The Park Service recommends continuing along the Coast Trail until you reach Wildcat Campground, and walking along the beach to approach the Falls, avoiding the crowded and eroded descent, though most people take the direct route.</p>
<p>While the view from above the falls is beautiful, the view of the lower falls from the beach is what makes this 8.4 mile hike so popular—you can dip your toes in the ocean while the falls tumble behind you. A favorite among locals and visitors alike, the Alamere Falls hike can be overwhelmingly crowded on weekends, so visit midweek or during the early morning if you can. The Coast Trailhead at Palomarin is about one hour from Golden Gate Bridge, just past the sleepy town of Bolinas.</p>
<p><strong>3. CATARACT FALLS</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--9mI3vVa_--/t_rr_large_traditional/p1ts13cizlbjzqdhhsfo.jpg"">

</figure>
<p>For another scenic waterfall hike, hike  the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/5-waterfall-hikes-around-san-francisco-perfect-winter-exploration"">Cataract Trail</a> from Alpine Lake as it climbs steeply up the north shoulder of Mt. Tamalpais. As it ascends through a primeval forest of redwoods, mossy oak trees, and lush ferns, the Cataract Trail passes several falls of varying heights. Hike the Cataract Falls Trail as it climbs towards Laurel Dell and the main section of Mt. Tamalpais State Park in a couple of hours, or extend your hike by connecting the trail with the warren of other trail options on Mt. Tam. The trailhead—just across Alpine Lake Dam—is ab an hour from San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>4. MT. DIABLO LOOP</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--sGsFJxVx--/t_rr_large_traditional/bljua1b97vkljsiandhq.jpg"">

<p>Rising 3,849 feet above San Francisco Bay, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/san-francisco-ca/hiking/mount-diablo-state-park-hiking"">Mt. Diablo</a> ’s summit beckons hikers seeking views that span from San Francisco Bay to the Sierra. From the summit, the view encompasses more square miles than any other vantage in the country. On a clear day, you can see the Delta, as far north as Lassen Peak, the Santa Cruz Mountains and Mt. Tamalpais in the west, and the peaks of Yosemite in the east—all before you begin hiking. Starting from the summit, follow a series of fire roads and trails as you wind your way along the slopes of Mt. Diablo, climbing about 2,500 feet over 7.8 miles through open fields dotted with wildflowers and woodsy groves. The entrance to Mt. Diablo State Park is under an hour from San Francisco, though it will add a few minutes to drive to the summit.</p>
<p><strong>5. REDWOOD REGIONAL PARK LOOP</strong></p>
<p>Containing the oldest stands of redwoods in the East Bay, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/san-francisco-ca/hiking/redwood-regional-park-east-ridge-trail-loop-hiking"">Redwood Regional Park</a> offers hikers sweeping views of the Oakland Hills and the delicate forest canopy. To complete a loop around the valley, follow the trails that trace the ridge lines for views over the redwoods and beyond. Begin on the West Ridge Trail—a wide fire road in most places—and catch views of San Francisco Bay and Mount Diablo. After following a short spur to climb Redwood Peak, continue along the West Ridge Trail until crossing the creek and joining the East Ridge Trail on the other side of the Valley to complete the loop.</p>
<p>The standard loop clocks in at 8.4 miles, though it’s well worth taking your time to meander side trails through the redwoods or along the creek. Without traffic, you can reach the park’s gates in under 40 minutes from the city.</p>
<p><strong>6. ANGEL ISLAND</strong></p>

<p>While you won’t find strenuous hiking on <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/the-5-most-instagram-worthy-hikes-around-san-francisco"">Angel Island</a> , the journey to the trail is as much of a highlight as the destination. For a classic weekend adventure, catch the Tiburon Ferry to Angel Island and spend the day exploring the trails of San Francisco Bay’s largest island. Expect panoramic views of the Bay, the city skyline, Golden Gate Bridge, and the East Bay from from the Island’s slopes. Hike to the summit of 788-foot Mt. Livermore for standout views, and connect with the Sunset Trail and the North Ridge Trail for a 5.9-mile loop of the Island’s best scenery. Access Angel Island by taking a 15-minute ferry ride across the Bay from Tiburon.</p>
<p><strong>7. SAN BRUNO RIDGE TRAIL</strong></p>

<p>Towering over south San Francisco and the Peninsula, the ridge line of San Bruno Mountain marks the northern extent of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Starting from the south parking lot, climb the Dairy Ravine or Eucalyptus Trails to attain the crest of the ridge. Once you reach the ridge, expect stunning, near 360-degree views over the city, the Bay, and beyond. As you follow the trail as it traverses east along the narrow ridge, your view of the Bay expands as the land falls away, giving you an almost bird’s-eye view of the landscape. Out-and-back along the wide open Ridge Trail is about 7 miles, with the only significant climb at the beginning through chaparral and eucalyptus. Located east of Daly City, it’s only about a 30-minute drive to San Bruno Mountain State Park.</p>

<p>Neighboring Boulder might steal a lot of the spotlight as a trail running mecca, but The Mile-High City is one of the top running towns in the country, too. Denver boasts 300 days of sunshine, friendly neighborhoods, breathtaking views to the west, and easy access to paved and dirt trails literally out the back door. It's also renowned for its gorgeous urban parks and trail systems that spider out from downtown following the rivers, creeks, and canals that helped build this great city.</p>
<p>These trails provide an excellent option to pounding pavement, without leaving the city (with the exception of one). Sure, you may have to cross some roads to get there, and some of these groovy jaunts give you the option to pound the bike path as well, but rest assured you’ve got plenty of dirt to dig without having to go far.</p>
<p><strong>Washington Park</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Yes, trail running is legitimate at Denver’s Wash Park, and some even say “jogging” in Denver was born here in the early 1970s. A flat, 2.6-mile dirt trail (adjacent to a paved trail) encircles 155 acres of fields and gently wooded spaces with two ponds, tennis courts, basketball courts and a fitness course. It’s extremely dog friendly (as long as they are leashed) and you’ll see many outdoor group fitness classes training in the mornings and evening, as well as a major volleyball contingent. Just don’t expect to get a lot of alone time here, as it’s a splendidly social running scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wash Park is at the intersection of Downing and Louisiana on the northwest corner, where you’ll find plenty of street parking.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry Creek, Clear Creek, and South Platte River Trails</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>All of these urban gems are widely known for both road running and bicycling, but they bear mentioning as three of the best trail runs near downtown Denver as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accessible from almost anywhere in the city, Cherry Creek Trail runs from downtown at Confluence Park (the confluence with the South Platte River) for 40 miles all the way out to Cherry Creek Reservoir. Any ultra runners out there can then do a lap around trails in lovely Cherry Creek Reservoir State Park, a major trail running destination on its own, before heading back into town.</p>
<p>Beginning at Confluence Park, you can run the Platte River Trail either north or south: Both directions feature a dirt track adjacent to the bike path. You can also run all the way to Chatfield Reservoir south of the city for beautiful open spaces and views. Note that the Platte River Trail becomes the Mary Carter Greenway past West Dartmouth Avenue, where you’ll have even more peaceful views.</p>
<p>Turn around at Chatfield State Park, and you'll have 30 miles to run (should you want to go that far) north to where the South Platte River meets Clear Creek. Clear Creek Trail, which is also a bike path with plenty of quality dirt track, leads all the way to Golden. Be sure and catch the left hand turn past the Sand Creek Trail turnoff just after the bridge.</p>
<p>All three of these offer trails runners a sense of nature as well as adventure in the heart of Denver. They're not exactly hidden gems, but at times you’ll find more solitude than you'd expect, along with wildlife and the sound of waters rushing alongside.</p>
<p><strong>The High Line Canal</strong></p>
<p>The High Line was completed in 1883 and is designated a National Landmark Trail, a true in-town treasure. The High Line Canal stretches 66 miles through Denver, allowing any variety of distances. To get there, make your way to Mamie D. Eisenhower Park, roughly in the middle of this historic pathway that runs from Cherry Creek to Chatfield Reservoir.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Head south through Magna Park, Three Pond Park, and Dahila Hollow Park and continue to the Marjorie Perry Nature Preserve. Or, head north and wind through the University Hills and Cherry Creek neighborhoods. (Burs on the trail can get stuck in your dog’s paws and fur and in your shoelaces, so look out for this common occurrence at any disturbed/regrowth area like a canal trail.)</p>
<p><strong>Alderfer/Three Sisters</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>A short drive up I-70 (about 30 miles) brings you to the old-school mountain town of Evergreen and the Alderfer/Three Sisters Park. This once-working ranch now offers 15 miles of trails for trail running, hiking, biking and a bouldering area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The winding collection of trails can be a bit confusing. A good place to begin is at the East Trailhead, where you can choose from six intertwining trails, from a moderate 3-mile run or a more aggressive 15-mile trek. Like most foothills runs, expect wildflowers, wildlife, and sunshine.</p>
<p>When you’re done dusting up the trail, head back into historic downtown Evergreen to visit the famed Little Bear, a dusty biker bar with decades of bras strung from the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Mathews/Winters Park</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<figure></figure>
<p>Always a classic and within easy distance of downtown, Mathews/Winters Park, nestled alongside Red Rocks Park and amphitheater, is a must do for locals and out-of-towners alike. Just off I-70, it offers an escape from the hustle and bustle of downtown Denver.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take the first right into the well-marked parking lot, where you can stretch and ensure your water is full and sunscreen is on, because once you cross the stream, it’s a pretty exposed run. The path quickly connects with Red Rocks Trail; run it to the end and return back along the Morrison Slide Trail to check off 6.5 miles. Beware of rattlesnakes and signs indicating usage for bikes and horses.</p>
<p>Right down the street from this trail-running mecca is the Apex Trail, accessed from the Heritage Square parking lot off Highway 93 just north of I-70.</p>

"589639811255","the-10-commandments-of-running-in-the-rockies","MERGE","The 10 Commandments of Running in the Rockies","Superfeet","<p>Mountain running has carved out an identity for itself in the Rockies. What was once a small cadre of dedicated enthusiasts has begun to resonate with athletes from other disciplines, from ultra-runners to day hikers. More than simply covering ground for the sake of movement, mountain running introduces the contrasting need for a deep understanding of the terrain with the promise of freedom while running in dynamic, ever-changing environments.</p>
<p>Whether looking to reach the top of your local hill or the lofty summits of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/colorados-top-ten-must-hike-14ers"">Colorado’s 14,000-foot peaks</a>, here are ten tips to help you get the most out of your time in the mountains</p>
<h2>1. New runners: Walk the steeps, run the flats</h2>
<p>One of the joys of mountain running is gauging the evolution of your skills. But if you’re new to the sport, the prospect of staying in motion up an imposing vertical ascent can be daunting. Experienced road runners are often disheartened at how taxing mountain ascents can be; after all, it requires a different type of strength and endurance. One good tip is to start out modestly by jogging the flats and modest inclines and walking the steeps (and steps)—but never stop moving. Work up to jogging through the steeps section by section and eventually piece a complete run together.</p>
<h2>2. Pack light (but not too light)</h2>
<p>On smaller, local mountains, minimalist gear (water, gels/food, good shoes) is fine, but as you explore into deeper, more remote regions you’ll need to be more prepared. A windproof/ waterproof jacket, arm warmers, small first aid kit, hat, and gloves should be carried when ascending above treeline no matter the time of year.</p>
<h2>3. Run the same trail to know thyself</h2>
<p>Mountain runners progress in different ways. Monitoring these improvements is best done by training on a familiar trail, where you can work on different skills. This is much more than registering your best time. There’s a lot to figure out: uphill footwork, downhill footwork, pacing, what works best for nutrition, when to recover, when to push, and even reading the weather make up the overall skill set of a mountain runner.</p>
<h6>Running at Hope Pass in the Sawatch Range. <small> </small>
</h6>
<h2>4. Stay hydrated and fueled</h2>
<p>While this rule applies for all disciplines of running, it’s even more vital for mountain runners. If anything, a slight bit of over-hydrating and over-fueling is a good idea. Your body will be working hard in ways different from road or trail running, especially when it comes to adapting to thin air.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t worry about your times</h2>
<p>This isn’t to say you shouldn’t do your best to improve, but don’t let your PR be the sole measure of how strong of a mountain runner you’ve become. Wind and weather often make each run a different experience, and getting into the mindset that you ran poorly because of variable trail conditions (or another runner’s PR) can allow you to sell yourself short. If there was a way to measure trail flow, it would likely be the strongest indicator of mountain running progress.<br><br></p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Use a short stride</h2>
<p>Nearly all competitive mountain runners use small, quick steps to master the ever-changing terrain under their feet. Stability and balance are skills whose importance are amplified in the hills. Mastering a confident stride and pace will allow you to feel sure-footed whether you’re rambling over roots, bouncing off boulders, or skipping through the snow.</p>
<h2>7. Don’t neglect downhill running skills</h2>
<p>Done right, rolling downhill can feel like floating over the landscape, each step a beautifully timed sequence used to flow down the trail. On the other extreme is the flailing, soon-to-be-face-planted runner who is simply reacting to the trail rather than moving in sync with the terrain. Running downhill is the same art trail runners employ but often at steeper pitches and for longer durations than normal trail runs. Work at becoming fluid and staying in control on your descents, especially when your quads are still searing from the climb.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<small> </small>
<h2>8. Above treeline, the rules of the mountains still apply</h2>
<p>Mountain running streamlines the human engine, so in theory you’ll be equipped to move faster than hikers or backpackers. But remember the mountains move to their own music. Weather, wildlife, unstable terrain, rivers, and snow all require adaptability by mountain runners. Maybe you need to carry micro-spikes or even an ice-axe for certain terrain, or perhaps it’s carrying bear bells and a headlamp. Staying light on your feet—and in your pack—is important, but not at the expense of the natural variables of the mountains.</p>
<h2>9. Run with a friend and leave a plan</h2>
<p>If you’re headed to remote areas, it’s highly recommended to go with a friend (or, at the very least, let someone know where you are beforehand). Running has a fairly tame reputation, but mountain running ups the stakes, and the last place you want to be is stuck in the remote backcountry miles from rescue. Consider carrying an emergency locator device if you enjoy solo exploration.</p>
<h2>10. Train with hill intervals</h2>
<p>The bane of many a high school athlete through the years, hills are a great way to train when you can’t make it to the mountains. Not only do they build explosive strength for ascending, they also let you power up your braking muscles for downhill sections. Timed intervals with jogging between hill sprints is a good way to simulate time on the mountain.</p>

<p>In many ways trail running is a completely different sport to road running. There are similarities of course, but when you’re off-road, pacing and mile splits tend to go out the window as you focus on tackling rugged terrain and exploring beautiful places. Trail running also has the potential to lift the spirits in a way that chugging along the pavement near your house struggles to do.</p>
<p>It’s a little trickier to get into than road running, but with a bit of planning you’ll find that there might be a host of great trail running spots far nearer to you than you think. Read on for wise words from British ultramarathon runner and The North Face ambassador Jez Bragg about how to get into trail running.</p>
<h2>Do you need trail-specific shoes for off-road running?</h2>
<p>In the summer, no, but you do in the winter when you have to deal with cold and wet conditions. You want something that’s cushioned with good grip on all different types of surfaces. It has to have wicking properties – to keep water out and let vapour out – and be light too, because you’ll really feel the extra weight if you’re covering any real distance. You should also carry a <a href=""https://www.coachmag.co.uk/running-gear/6233/the-best-running-backpacks"">small rucksack</a> or hydration pack. Put a spare waterproof, <a href=""https://www.coachmag.co.uk/running/6210/the-best-base-layers-for-warm-and-cold-weather-training"">base layer</a>, map, food, drink and mobile phone in it so you can cope with changing weather and getting lost or injured.</p>
<h2>Should you change your running style on treacherous trails?</h2>
<p>Aim to look about 6-10m ahead so you have time to adjust your speed or change direction. It takes a bit of getting used to but having to focus on finding the smoothest, most direct route takes your mind off running and some of the pain you’re enduring.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What’s the best way to tackle hills?</h2>
<p>When climbing, shorten your stride, lean forwards and settle into a steady rhythm. Depending on how steep the hill is, you will probably find it more comfortable to run up it on your toes. When running down a hill you’ll be moving faster so look a few metres further ahead than if you were on the flat. This will help you pick the right line. Avoid slowing down because it’ll tire you and sprinting because it can stretch your quads to the point of injury. Try to relax and let the gradient of the hill turn your legs over – you’ll know when you’re moving at the right speed because you’ll be exerting the minimum amount of effort.</p>
<h2>Can you train for trails without actually running on them?</h2>
<p>You need good core and lower leg strength to help your body withstand the rigours of running across rough and uneven terrain and you can build this in the gym doing moves, such as <a href=""https://www.coachmag.co.uk/core-exercises/6334/how-to-do-a-plank-and-build-a-core-of-steel"">planks</a> and weighted <a href=""https://www.coachmag.co.uk/exercises/leg-exercises/197/lunge"">lunges</a>. Ankle strength is also key but is something that can only be developed through running. Hills are a big part of trail running so you also need to include hill work in your runs. Don’t worry if you need to walk the hills to start with – it will still help you build up solid leg strength.</p>

"589639745719","the-importance-of-having-a-defined-goal-for-your-running","MERGE","The Importance of Having a Defined Goal for Your Running","Superfeet","<p>When you find the right groove, running is joyful. You’re comfortable in stride and feel like you can go forever. But as soon as your energy starts flagging, you may start wondering, “Why am I doing this?” If you don’t have a good answer, your run may turn into a walk, and that walk may turn into never getting out the door at all.</p>
<p>Keeping yourself motivated is a big part of your training—and it starts with setting goals for yourself. If you’re a new runner, the goal may be making it one block farther than your previous run, completing your first race, or finishing a marathon. If you’re a consistent runner, your goal may be to set a personal time record, introduce cross-training to your regimen, or qualify for the Boston Marathon. No matter what your goals are, here are four steps to successfully achieving them.</p>
<h2>1. Find Your Motivation</h2>
<h6>Having a goal race can help you with daily motivation. <small> Mārtiņš Zemlickis </small>
</h6>
<p>When setting any goal, start with your “why.” Reasons for running are as personal as fingerprints. Your motive may be to stay fit, to lose weight, or to find camaraderie with other runners. Every reason is a good one. Here are a few questions to help you find inspiration.</p>
<p>• Why do you want to be a runner or why do you like running?</p>
<p>• What do you gain from participating in running?</p>
<p>• Is there anything you would like to accomplish in running that you haven’t already?</p>
<p>• How will you be different or will things be different if you accomplish this goal?</p>
<p>When the miles get long, or it seems like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel, this “why” will keep you going. Some runners write their “whys” on their hands or wear shoelace charms engraved with words or mantras to remind them of their motivation.</p>
<h2>2. Get SMART</h2>
<p>In his book Meb for Mortals, New York City Marathon and Boston Marathon winner Meb Keflezighi writes, “Your goals should require you to reach outside your comfort zone while remaining within the realm of possibility.” One way to do that is to set SMART goals, yes, just like your high school teacher taught you. The goals should be:</p>
<p>S – Specific</p>
<p>M – Measurable</p>
<p>A – Action Required</p>
<p>R – Realistic</p>
<p>T – Timely</p>
<p>Luckily for runners, specific goals (e.g., completing a race or setting a PR) are also immediately measurable. Setting realistic goals and time frames is more challenging. In this case, it may be useful to start with a long-term goal, like running a marathon and break it into smaller steps. For example, if you want to run a marathon in a year, what’s your goal for six months from now? What are your benchmarks for this month? This week?</p>
<p>Setting these short-term goals also will help you build confidence in completing your overall objective. If you ran two miles for this week’s long run, a three-mile run next week won’t look so difficult. Each training run you complete gets your body and your mind one step closer to achieving the long-term goal.</p>
<p>When you encounter obstacles—like an injury or illness—stay flexible with your goals. Missing a few runs doesn’t mean you’ve failed or won’t be able to achieve your chief aim. However, you may need to re-evaluate your goal. When obstacles come up, get back on track by going back to your “why” and SMART goal setting.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Write It Down</h2>
<p>Once you have your goal, make it concrete. Dr. Gail Matthews, at Dominican University in California, led a study on goal-setting and found participants were 42 percent more likely to achieve their goals if they wrote them down.</p>
<p>A neurological function helps explain why this works: In the process of encoding, our brains decide what gets stored in our long-term memory and what gets discarded. Writing something down improves this process. In other words, we have a much higher chance of remembering goals if we record them.</p>
<p>Writing down your goal brings you closer to achieving it. And setting short-term goals helps you get out the door and onto the road, trail, or treadmill with purpose. Take the time to establish a training plan, which will enable you to not only set mileage or time goals but also mix in a variety of workouts over the course of the weeks ahead.</p>
<h2>4. Tell a Friend</h2>
<p>Sharing your goal makes it real—and makes you more likely to accomplish it. Dr. Matthews’ study found that more than 70 percent of participants who sent updates to a friend about their process reported they achieved their goal, compared to only 35 percent who kept their goals to themselves. Sharing your goal may help you gain clarity. Talking over your goal may help you sharpen it.</p>
<p>Of course, running with a partner or a group can help you achieve your goals. But even speaking your goal aloud can motivate you to take action and stay on track—even if no one is acting as your accountability coach.</p>
<p>What’s most important? Just keep running. Dean Karnazes, American ultramarathon runner and author of Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner, advises, “Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.”</p>

"589639712951","national-parks-too-crowded-visit-these-nearby-national-forests-instead","MERGE","National Parks Too Crowded? Visit These Nearby National Forests Instead","Superfeet","<p>The national parks of the United States account for some of the world’s most glorious landscapes: ice-whittled peaks, abyssal gorges, primeval seashores, towering forests, kaleidoscopic deserts—well, you probably don’t need us to repeat the litany of superlatives, now do you? Tens of millions from all over the globe partake of the National Park System’s majesties every year—from the Everglades to Denali, from Death Valley to Congaree.</p>
<p>Amid this thoroughly well-deserved adoration for these sacred places, it’s also worth exploring the national forests that often border the parks—especially if you’re looking to duck at least some of the crowds. Taking a gander at adjoining Forest Service lands lets you see the topographic and ecological whole of which a given national park is just a component of. After all, it’s easy to mistake Arches or Shenandoah as standalone chunks of natural majesty, forgetting that mountain ranges and rivers and animals and weather don’t abide by sharp jurisdictional boundaries.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the coin, crisscrossing the national park/national forest borders helps you better appreciate how different management strategies cooked up on paper actually make their physical mark on the landscape. (The National Park Service and the USDA Forest Service, after all, have distinct, if overlapping, guiding principles, and it’s illuminating for any outdoors-person to consider the on-the-ground differences.)</p>
<p>Here’s a broad-stroked roundup of the national forests shouldering 10 of the most-visited national parks in 2018. (One popular park, Maine’s Acadia saw more than 3.5 million visitors in 2018, but it isn't part of this list as it doesn’t have adjacent federal lands.) The forestlands profiled here serve as promising options for finding some elbow room near some of America’s best-loved outdoor playgrounds, and they’re home to some truly world-class scenery and recreation all their own.</p>
<h2>1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park | Cherokee, Pisgah, &amp; Nantahala National Forests</h2>
<p>Home to some of the world’s richest temperate forests and some of the East’s highest peaks and most extensive backcountry, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/a-guide-to-the-great-smoky-mountains-national-park"">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> is a marvel—one appreciated firsthand by more than 11.4 million people in 2018.</p>
<p>More Southern Appalachian magic awaits, though, in the national forestland bordering the park to its west, south, and east. Bliss out among giant tulip trees and other barrel-trunked ancients in the old-growth cove-hemlock forest of the Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness. Run the whitewater of the Nantahala, mountain bike the Tsali Recreation Area along Fontana Lake, or goggle at Bald River Falls in the Bald River Gorge. Wherever you go, keep an eye peeled for the fat and sassy black bears and feral hogs that both prosper in these rugged, fertile highlands.</p>
<h2>2. Grand Canyon National Park | Kaibab National Forest</h2>
<p>Set the head-spinning gash of the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-grand-canyon-national-park"">Grand Canyon</a> in its full context by rambling around the Kaibab N.F. bracketing both the north and south sides of Grand Canyon National Park (which welcomed more than 6.3 million people last year). From pinyon-juniper scrub to ponderosa parklands to subalpine spruce-fir timber, the Kaibab, split among three districts, encompasses some awesome Colorado Plateau ecology—and downright limitless recreational possibilities for experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>In the Kanab Creek Wilderness, trek into the redrock depths of the Kanab Creek Canyon gouging the Kaibab and Kanab plateaus as it drains to the Grand Canyon. On the Kaibab Plateau north of the Canyon, scout for the resident (and controversial) bison herd and dark, high-soaring California condors. Beyond the South Rim, journey across the Coconino Plateau to the Kaibab’s southernmost sector, where you can survey 10,418-foot Kendrick Peak’s dizzying summit panorama. Or mountain bike one of the most scenic rides in the country along the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/the-rainbow-rim-trail-the-only-place-to-mountain-bike-along-the-grand-canyon"">Rainbow Rim Trail</a>, the only place to mountain bike along the Grand Canyon.</p>
<h2>3. Rocky Mountain National Park | Arapaho &amp; Roosevelt National Forests</h2>
<p>More than 4.5 million people visited <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-rocky-mountain-national-park"">Rocky Mountain National Park</a> in 2018, and it’s no surprise why—with more than 70 Front Range summits above 12,000 feet, oceanic tundra, glassy tarns, and huge wapiti herds on tap. But don’t overlook the flanking Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests. Four national forest wilderness areas directly border the park, and they’re just as stirring: from the litter of 13,000-plus-foot horns in the Indian Peaks Wilderness (which includes part of Colorado’s biggest glacier, the Arapaho) to the granite benches in the pint-sized Neota Wilderness.</p>
<p>You can also drive America’s highest paved road up to 14,264-foot Mount Evans, an iconic Front Range 14er, which harbors some of Colorado’s northernmost groves of tough-as-nails, crazy-long-lived Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines. Meanwhile, Boulder Canyon calls to rock climbers as irresistibly as the Cache la Poudre Wild and Scenic River does to whitewater kayakers and rafters.</p>
<h2>4. Zion National Park | Dixie National Forest</h2>
<p>Okay, so the Dixie—Utah’s biggest national forest, straddling the physiographic frontier of the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau—doesn’t directly abut <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-zion-national-park"">Zion National Park</a> (4.32 million visitors in 2018), but it’s mighty close by, and it claims scenery to stand proudly alongside the national park’s sublime canyonlands. Tramp the Summit Trail through the wilderness-protected high country of the Pine Valley Mountains, with their shadowy spruce woods, sculptured bristlecone pines, and fine prospects of Zion’s colorful geology. Or bushwhack the wild canyons of the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness, where ephemeral streamers and hanging gardens pattern sandstone walls. Solitude ain’t hard to come by in the Dixie.</p>
<h2>5. Yellowstone National Park | Gallatin, Custer, Shoshone, Bridger-Teton, &amp; Caribou-Targhee National Forests</h2>
<p>With its epic geyser basins and plentiful wildlife, the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-yellowstone-national-park"">world's oldest national park</a>—which hosted some 4.1 million in 2018—is, it goes without saying, a must-see. So, too, though, is the vast and wild Forest Service acreage nestling Yellowstone: critical public lands in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem framework.</p>
<p>For one thing, it’s in these national forests of its hinterland where Yellowstone’s mountainscapes crescendo to all-out alpine grandeur—from the matterhorn tooth of Pilot Peak in the Absarokas to the high, weather-beaten rockland of the Beartooth Plateau. You’ve got primo day hikes and world-class backcountry that feels just as primal as Yellowstone’s roadless (and grizzlied) depths, not least in the Teton Wilderness, which encompasses the corner of one of the Lower 48’s largest roadless areas. And awesome Greater Yellowstone water awaits: on the Madison River through Bear Trap Canyon and on the Yellowstone through Yankee Jim Canyon in the Gallatin N.F., and on the North Fork Shoshone in the Absarokas of the Shoshone N.F., to name a few standouts.</p>
<h2>6. Yosemite National Park | Sierra, Inyo, Humboldt-Toiyabe, &amp; Stanislaus National Forests</h2>
<p>In 2018, more than 4 million people clapped eyes on the near-mythic landscapes of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-yosemite-national-park"">Yosemite National Park</a>, epitomized by the granite-walled glen of Yosemite Valley. If this world-famous park’s throngs (and car-burglarizing black bears) have you down, consider embellishing your Yosemite visit with some High Sierra adventuring in the adjacent national forests.</p>
<p>The scenery’s certainly Yosemite-caliber, whether you’re talking Thousand Island Lake beneath Banner Peak in the Ritter Range or the prospect of the otherworldly Mono Basin from the scoured heights of the Dana Plateau. And you can wander a colony of godly giant sequoias, the Nelder Grove, that’s typically much quieter than Yosemite’s three sequoia stands.</p>
<h2>7. Grand Teton National Park | Caribou-Targhee &amp; Bridger-Teton National Forests</h2>
<p>More than 3.4 million people basked in the glory of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-grand-teton-national-park"">Grand Teton National Park</a> in 2018, meditating on those iconic snarled Teton fangs, boating on the Snake River or the big foothill lakes, oohing-and-aahing over moose and black bears and white pelicans and coyotes. Two of the same national forests that buttress Yellowstone rub shoulders with Grand Teton as well: the slender Caribou-Targhee (mostly in Idaho) and the 3.4-million-acre Bridger-Teton (in Wyoming), one of the biggest national forests in the country.</p>
<p>The Caribou-Targhee’s Jedediah Smith Wilderness offers sublime backcountry approaches to the Teton high country. Hike up Teton Canyon to the rock garden of Alaska Basin, for example, which is also reachable by the outstanding Teton Crest Trail. And the portion of Bridger-Teton N.F. nearest Grand Teton National Park includes the sweeping limestone heights of the Gros Ventre Range, a critical corridor between the Greater Yellowstone and the Wind River Range and the summer pasture for many of the wapiti that winter in great number in the National Elk Refuge. The Gros Ventre Slide National Geological Area presents the scene of a massive 1925 landslide that dammed the Gros Ventre to form Lower Slide Lake.</p>
<h2>8. Olympic National Park | Olympic National Forest</h2>
<p><a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-olympic-national-park"">Olympic National Park</a>, experienced by some 3.1 million in 2018, is famously diverse: from a raw, stormy seacoast and some of the world’s standout temperate rainforests to high-country glaciers and drier rainshadow conifer woods. Olympic N.F.—home to five wilderness areas—partly buffers the park on all its aspects, offering something of a similar variety pack.</p>
<p>Near national forestland on the south shore of Lake Quinault grows some of the world’s mightiest trees, including among the very biggest Douglas-firs and Sitka spruces anywhere. On the other side of the Olympic Peninsula, Seal Rock offers a rare Forest Service developed campground on saltwater: a serene Puget Sound counterpart to the camping available across the mountains along Olympic National Park’s outer coast. And if you’re a hardcore mountain lover, the Olympic National Forest wildernesses on the park’s eastern boundary include some of the signal peaks of the Olympics: the Brothers in the Brother Wilderness, for example, and Mounts Skokomish, Cruiser, and Pershing in the Mount Skokomish Wilderness.</p>
<h2>9. Glacier National Park | Flathead &amp; Lewis and Clark National Forests</h2>
<p>With its layer cake Canadian Rockies-style peaks, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-glacier-national-park"">Glacier National Park</a> (2.96 million visitors in 2018) marks one of America’s great mountainscapes, and it anchors a globally significant wildland complex: the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem. Some awesome Crown of the Continent vistas—and some raw Rocky Mountain backcountry—await you just outside the park, too.</p>
<p>The Flathead N.F. contributes most of the national-forest acreage fringing Glacier, although the Lewis and Clark N.F. borders its southeastern segment along the Rocky Mountain Front. One of the treasures of the Flathead is the 287,00-acre Great Bear Wilderness, headwaters of the Middle Fork Flathead River and major component of the massive Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex—one of the biggest roadless chunks in the Lower 48. The wilderness is aptly named, too: You’ll be sharing the river bottoms, avalanche chutes, and high meadows with lots of grizzlies, which find one of their standout refuges in the Crown of the Continent backlands. Then there’s the Jewel Basin Hiking Area in the Swan Mountains, open only to foot travelers and glinting with more than two dozen high-country lakes.</p>
<h2>10. Joshua Tree National Park | San Bernardino National Forest</h2>
<p>With its yucca savannas and bouldery inselbergs, <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-joshua-tree-national-park"">Joshua Tree National Park</a>, sprawled along the messy seam between the Mojave and Colorado deserts, presents as ethereal a landscape as you’ll find in North America. In terms of bordering federal acreage, the most extensive is managed by the Bureau of Land Management—including the vast, newly minted Mojave Trails National Monument that links Joshua Tree with Mojave National Preserve to the north. (No question: The epic BLM holdings within shouting distance of national parks deserve their own treatment.)</p>
<p>But you don’t have to travel far from Joshua Tree (more than 2.9 million visitors in 2018) to hit national forest: specifically the San Bernardino N.F. to the west, spread across the easternmost Transverse Ranges of the San Bernardino, San Jacinto, and Santa Rosa mountains. These are major uplifts. The San Bernardinos swell to Southern California’s loftiest peak, 11,503-foot San Gorgonio Mountain (aka Old Greyback). For tracing the gradient between desert lowlands and Tranverse Range crests, you can’t do better than the Sand to Snow National Monument, established (along with Mojave Trails) in February 2016 and jointly managed by the BLM and the San Bernardino N.F.; it includes Old Greyback in the San Gorgonio Wilderness.</p>

"589639680183","speed-up-your-recovery-with-these-stretches-for-runners","MERGE","Speed Up Your Recovery With These Stretches For Runners","Superfeet","<h3>A little post-run stretching goes a long way.</h3>
<p>Everyone knows you should do some stretching after a run, just like everyone knows you should eat five servings of fruit and veg a day. But knowing something and doing it are very different things. Most people just want to take off their sneakers and hit the shower as soon as they finish a run.</p>
<p>However, spending five minutes stretching after your training will help your muscles recover and prepare them for your next workout. To help you do the right thing after your next run, we enlisted Richard Tidmarsh, strength and conditioning coach and founder of Reach Fitness, and Chris Magee, head of yoga at Another_Space, for some great post-run stretches.</p>
<h4>Twisted Lizard</h4>
<p>You start this stretch in the runner’s lunge position, which just happens to be another great stretch. From a standing position, put your hands either side of your feet. Then take a big stride back with one foot so the back leg is straight and your front knee is bent at a 90° angle.</p>
<p>“From the runner’s lunge position, drop your back knee to the floor and untuck your toes,” says Magee. “Turn your chest in the direction of your front leg. This may be enough of a stretch for your quad and hip flexor – if so, stop here and breathe. If you need more of a stretch, bring your back foot up and reach your hand back to catch your foot. If you can’t reach your foot, use a belt or strap. Hold the pose for a minimum of 30 seconds.”</p>
<h4>Seated Forward Fold</h4>
<p>Start this stretch by sitting down with your legs straight out in front of you.</p>
<p>“Keeping your and your feet feet flexed, sit upright so your spine is as straight as possible, then fold forwards over your thighs,” says Magee. ""Focus on lengthening your lower back while squeezing your quads. Grab your toes and pull your elbows back towards your hips to go deeper into the pose. If you can’t grab your toes, use a belt or strap around the balls of your feet. Hold the stretch for 30-60 seconds.”</p>
<h4>Pigeon</h4>
<p>“From a press-up position, bring your right leg up and place it so your knee is by your right wrist and your right foot is by your left wrist, with your shin parallel to your chest,” says Tidmarsh. “From this position sit down into the stretch, initially keeping your chest up and making sure your hips are square with your shoulders. Then slowly drop your chest forwards and hold the stretch for 30 seconds. You will feel a deep stretch in your right glute and lower back. Breathe, stretch and enjoy. Then repeat on the other side.”</p>
<h4>Jiu jitsu</h4>
<p>“This is a great move to open your hips and stretch your quads after a run,” says Tidmarsh. “Sit on the floor with your legs out straight. Then bend your right leg and place the sole of your right foot on your left thigh. Then bend your left leg out to the left. Then place your right elbow on the floor behind you (if you can) and feel the stretch in your right hip and left quad. To increase the stretch, place your elbow further away from you. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.”</p>
<h4>Scorpion</h4>
<p>“The scorpion is a great way to stretch a long chain of muscles all the way from your quad to your upper back,” says Tidmarsh. “Lie on your front with arms spread to create a T shape. Lift your left leg and move it over your right in a wide arc, aiming to land your left foot as close to your right hand as possible. Do two or three reps to create distance, then hold at your maximum range for 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.”</p>
<h4>J hang</h4>
<p>“This is a simple and effective way to stretch your entire posterior chain, lengthening your back and hamstrings,” says Tidmarsh. “Stand on a small step, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Tuck your chin into your chest and slowly “roll” your spine forwards to your full extension, with your arms hanging in front of you. Keeping your chin tucked, take six deep breaths, trying to increase the depth of the stretch on the exhale.”</p>

<p>Forget the bus – if given the choice, more than half of all Americans would rather walk, new research suggests.</p>
<p>According to a new poll of 2,002 adults, 54% would choose walking as their preferred mode of transportation whenever possible.</p>
<p>In fact, three in five said they’d be willing to walk a mile before seeking other methods of transportation.</p>
<p>Almost half (46%) are using a step counter to track their progress.</p>
<p>Respondents reported taking an average of 5,900 steps a day, but hope to almost double that amount in 2022 by adding 5,430 steps to their daily tally.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Superfeet, found that getting those extra steps in isn’t a walk in the park.</p>
<p>One third of respondents said they avoid walking due to chronic pain. While some attributed this pain to standing all day at work, another 31% blamed uncomfortable footwear.</p>
<p>But respondents are taking action against their foot pain, regardless of the cause. Almost three in 10 (29%) use footbeds or pads, 27% opt for <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">insoles</a> and 24% stick with <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/me3d"">orthotic devices</a>.</p>
<p>Respondents also reported easing foot pain with over the counter oral pain medication (30%) and therapeutic socks (26%).</p>
<p>One third of respondents rack up the most steps per day by taking the stairs. In fact, two-thirds (67%) will climb between three and eight flights of stairs on any given day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, others increase their step counts by multi-tasking or knocking out other daily chores; about one-third (34%) get steps by walking their dog and 36% do so by running errands.</p>
<p>But the majority (42%) accumulate their steps by exercising. Similarly, 44% of respondents choose to walk to get a quick workout in and burn some calories.</p>
<p>“If you are starting to incorporate walking as exercise, try easing in wearing a step counter and gradually increasing your steps each week,” says Matt Gooch, M.S., C.Ped, and V.P. of Product and Innovation at Superfeet. “Don't wait for pain to slow you down; one of the most important things you can do from the beginning is make sure your footwear fits and functions properly. Many local retailers offer gait analysis and expert advice on footwear and insole fitting.”</p>
<p>And although 44% of respondents reported going on strolls to enjoy the weather, hot temperatures may be a strong deterrent, even more so than cold ones.</p>
<p>Two in five (41%) would avoid walking over other transportation methods during the summer, compared to 17% who said the same about walking during winter.</p>
<p>Speed might be another factor; almost four in five (78%) of respondents self-identified as fast walkers, and two-thirds said that they get frustrated when stuck behind slower walkers.</p>
<p>While they might be frustrated, they don’t show it — 67% of respondents will instead just follow the pace of the crowd around them.</p>
<p>Three-quarters (76%) admitted to walking faster when walking with family or friends.</p>
<p>“Data shows that scheduling walks with friends and agreeing on a regular walking time is a great way to keep yourself accountable. If you can’t get outdoors, head to your local mall,” said Gooch. “Studies have found that mall walking is a safe, accessible, and affordable exercise environment. They provide a temperature-controlled environment with a flat, predictable surface and stairwells to increase intensity.”</p>
</div>
<h3>TOP 5 WAYS PEOPLE ACQUIRE THEIR STEPS</h3>
<div>
<p>● Exercising (43%)</p>
<p>● Going for walks (41%)</p>
<p>● Running errands (36%)</p>
<p>● Taking stairs (34%)</p>
<p>● Walking their dog/pet (34%)</p>

Insider Tips for a Great Race","Superfeet","<p>If you’re reading this, odds are good you’ve registered for (or are thinking about) your first 5K. Maybe you’d like to kick-start a New Year’s Resolution, want to lose a few post-holiday pounds, or are looking for a new challenge.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there’s a lot to know and love about running your first 5K. The run itself will likely include festive pageantry, supportive friends and family, and (in most cases) a cool T-shirt or finisher’s medal at the finish line. But there’s a lot to know before race day, including dietary tips, training methods, and basic runner’s etiquette—and, of course, how to calm those inevitable nerves. Here, insider tips for running your first 5K.</p>
<h2>1. Pick your race wisely.</h2>
<h6>Do some research beforehand to choose a 5K that’s right for you. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/josiahmackenzie/3414064391/in/photolist-6cFYpa-56qG1-4hyD7A-o5YRJ2-ny9yFH-cBJySj-f555U5-agD6WP-dH86ie-6Lvmyu-aNT1Ye-eKH2V6-dyJyoA-hb8zDA-dLDUNL-bndY8w-bWcv9a-hb7USQ-dYcvzq-Bz77oT-9jhQ4a-8nmPj9-fKPVY-4CD6JZ-F4L92-bya77T-dHcmq9-raDoXb-fvWJA-4CD6fc-4CHn6J-4CD934-4CHpjh-djBSPd-4CHpXb-pD3SM3-djCiZp-djCjt9-4CHob7-4CDbRv-4CD7SV-3gd1KG-4CDaLg-bS9vAD-8PhF1R-c8YitY-4DB8Ab-2Ppoc-5Kq8TJ-p7RKeJ"">Josiah Mackenzie</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>A big part of the fun of running races is choosing them, and fortunately, race calendars are full of all kinds of 5Ks, from obstacle runs to costume races to charity events. Several online resources (including <a href=""http://www.runningintheusa.com/Race/List.aspx?State=AL"">Running USA</a> and <a href=""http://www.active.com/running"">Active.com</a>) allow you to search by region and date, and local running groups also have their own running calendars, too. A few considerations to make while you’re choosing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unless you’re a regular runner, be sure to allow enough training time beforehand (more on that below). In other words, if you’ve never run more than a mile, don’t choose a 5K for the following weekend thinking you can power through it. You’re likely to end up frustrated and possibly injured—not a recommended way to experience your first race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Popular races usually sell out in advance, so if you have your eye on one, it’s better to sign up as early as possible. You’ll likely save money on early registration, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller races are a great way for newbies to experience the running atmosphere without feeling overwhelmed. (Bonus: If the race is really small, your odds of placing in your age group—and taking home some hardware—go up.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costumed runs are a lot of fun, but costumes can also add a logistical challenge. Make sure whatever you’re wearing isn’t a tripping hazard and doesn’t cause blisters or other irritations that can sabotage your good time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Find a Running Group.</h2>
<p>Running groups can keep you accountable, help you prepare for the rigors of a race, and offer invaluable guidance for training and preparation. A few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Group runs:</strong> Most running groups hold regular group runs of varying distances and paces. Odds are good you’ll find a few running buddies to keep you motivated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> Experienced runners are happy to share tips, tricks, and wisdom they’ve picked up along the way. They may help you develop a comfortable pace, find the right pair of running shoes, and offer basic training tips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discounts:</strong> Running groups are often sponsored by, started by, or otherwise affiliated with local athletic retailers. Membership might include discounts on shoes, clothes, accessories, and race fees around town.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>3. Figure Out a Workable Training Regimen.</h2>
<p>Everyone builds up stamina at a different pace. Don’t force yourself into running longer or more often than feels comfortable; doing so only increases the risk of burnout and injury.</p>
<p>Instead, find a training program that suits your goals and fitness levels. Here are a few programs (also available as mobile apps) to help get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml"">The Couch to 5K Running Plan</a> is a popular program for total newbies. Couch to 5K eases runners into their first race with a slow, but steady, increase in running times over nine weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://runkeeper.com/"">RunKeeper</a> tracks workouts, offers personalized training programs, and more. The app, which boasts a userbase of more than 50 million, offers a social function that connects you with friends and allows you to compare progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href=""https://zombiesrungame.com/"">Zombies, Run!</a> app makes training fun by dropping runners into a post-apocalyptic zombie epidemic. The app delivers missions through headphones and makes a game of it with rewards for successfully staying alive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Keep an Eye on Your Diet.</h2>
<p>Michael Scott might have carbo-loaded before a 5k on a hilarious episode of ""The Office,"" but you shouldn’t follow his lead. Here, a few tips on eating right and hydrating leading up to your first 5K:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t carb up:</strong> A 5K covers 3.1 miles and is an incredible accomplishment for runners of all fitness levels. That said, it’s not long or strenuous enough for your body to demand a surplus of carbs. Rather than weighing yourself down with a huge plate of spaghetti carbonara the night before, aim for a light, healthy meal full of lean proteins, veggies, and rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t gorge afterward:</strong> It might be tempting to reward yourself with an extravagant feast afterward, but try not to overdo it. Don’t use your race as an excuse to go all out; you’ll feel weighed down and uncomfortable if you dive right into celebratory burgers and beers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink plenty of water:</strong> It might seem obvious, but that doesn’t make it any less important. Drink plenty of water before (and during the race, if you need to; most 5Ks have at least one water station). Dehydration can sap your energy and lead to cramps, both of which can cut your first 5K short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t try anything new on race morning (or the night before).</strong> The 24 hours leading up to your race are not the time to test out that new Thai recipe—or any new-to-you foods. Stick with what you know to avoid any gastrointestinal disasters while on the course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Find a Comfortable Pace.</h2>
<p>Imagine the moment when you step to the starting line for your first 5K. Maybe a few friends are cheering you on from the sidelines. Perhaps the speaker system pumps you up with ""Eye of the Tiger."" Maybe you’re simply blown away by the outlandish costumes some runners choose to wear.</p>
<p>In any event, odds are good you’ll feel a wide range of emotions at that point. But even with all that adrenaline and excitement coursing through your body, try to be mindful of your pace and find a comfortable clip. If possible, find the sweet spot where you’re getting a good workout but not wearing yourself out with every step. A good rule of thumb is if you can carry on a conversation with someone.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to sprint off the start line (or even do it instinctively), but be sure to save some energy for near the finish line, once the adrenaline has faded. You’re more likely to finish strong—and feeling great about your effort.</p>
<h2>6. Observe Race (and Course) Etiquette.</h2>
<h6>Observing some basic running etiquette will make your first 5K much smoother. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/gotovan/8670248493/in/photolist-edahNZ-7wo8r7-edabin-7wo7H5-edfRcY-muKvUu-edaqTp-dzuNAq-edaePT-9HZGk1-cUgPos-7scCLy-5fUe8a-eda7bi-edg2NC-dzpiDp-7wo7RG-7wo7SJ-4HD4Te-7wo8uC-edfULo-7wo7DS-edg4yG-7wo7TU-vJ5sbC-7SBt7k-7wjiVz-9zn9cD-dzpiye-eda2qv-dzv3ZL-eda6nK-pE9o8W-dzuNzy-dzv4kL-oj1B73-dzpiCK-vJ4uvu-dCn4fS-uMN7Wc-edameR-dzpywH-a2tVWK-dzpxEF-7wo7Y1-8jnG4W-e4m4Xb-gSRaV6-dzpiE2-f7TpcN"">GoToVan</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Running a 5K involves more than simply showing up. There are numerous unwritten rules and common courtesies runners should abide by, but it’s difficult to discern what they are during your first race. Some are common sense, and some are more specific to running circles, but here are a few important points to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Find your place in the pack:</strong> Be mindful of where you wind up; faster runners congregate in the front of the pack, while slower runners (naturally) lag behind. And be sure to stay right when walking or running at a much slower pace, and don’t try to pass in packed groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ditch the headphones:</strong> We get it: There’s no better way to get the blood pumping than with a kicky song blaring into your eardrums. That said, headphones take you out of the moment and make it impossible for other racers to communicate while trying to pass (or alert you to hazards). They also make it tough to hear cars, trains, and bicycles. And the supporters cheering you on at the finish line—you want to hear them, right? If you must listen to music, keep it at a low volume, and only wear one earbud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jam the finish line:</strong> Yes, you’re trying to finish your first 5K, but don’t stop running until you are well through the finish line. This area is one of the most congested in the race, and it’s always made worse from unknowing (or inconsiderate) runners crowding things up further by stopping to walk or pose for post-race photos. (The one exception is if you need immediate assistance from the medical team; if that’s the case, try to step to the side until you can flag down a volunteer.) Instead, jog your way through the finish area to the good stuff: post-race snacks, freebies, and the area for the race results. And no matter what your time is, take heart in the fact that you crossed the finish line.</p>
</li>

"589639581879","find-your-way-through-canyon-country","MERGE","Find Your Way Through Canyon Country","Superfeet","<p><strong>Footprints peeled off </strong> into a lonesome canyon and we followed, around bends and across sandy benches, until the canyon walls closed in and sunlight turned to shadow. We were supposed to be nearing an exit, but there didn’t seem to be any end in sight. I stopped hiking and called out to my partner for a map check.</p>
<p>Experienced hikers never get lost. They get off-route or miss a turn, take a scenic detour once in a while, but they don’t get lost. After years of hiking together, Tom, Jason, and I had taken the scenic route a time or two, but when we set out on a backpacking trip in The Maze, we made sure to check the map often.</p>
<p>The Maze District is a remote section of Canyonlands National Park. Owing to its difficult routefinding, only about 2,500 backpackers walk it in a given year. The Park Service doesn’t put up many signs out there. The roads are so bad it can take all day just to get to some of the trailheads. The trails themselves are few and hard to follow, twisting through intersecting canyons, and water is scarce. It wasn’t named by accident.</p>
<p>It took us four days to reach our starting point, because we paddled 52 miles on the Green River from Mineral Bottom to get there, floating under red cliffs by day, sleeping on sandy beaches at night. By the time we made camp at Spanish Bottom, past the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers, we were ready for whatever The Maze had in store for us. The next day we ditched the canoes and set out on foot.</p>
<p>About a decade ago, Tom and I had tried the same route. We’d paddled for days down the Green, stashed the canoe, and started hiking on another bright and sunny day. We didn’t pay as much attention to our routefinding back then and took a couple wrong turns. Off-course in the miles and miles of sand and towering stone, we never made it to our destination: the Harvest Scene, the most well-known rock art in The Maze. This time we reached it without incident after 10 miles of expert navigating through shady canyons and sunlit junctions. The enormous petroglyph panel stretched far above us, depicting tall, wraith-like figures painted by archaic hunter-gatherers who had once called these canyons home. They knew these canyons much better than we ever will, paper map or no.</p>
<p>The names in the map fell into place as we hiked onward: Ernies Country, Horse Canyon, Chimney Rock, Happy Canyon. Each correctly identified—and reached—landmark came with a renewed sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>We made our way up a series of switchbacks from river to rim, where hoodoos stood sentry over a high desert expanse. Dropping back down to a labyrinth of gray slickrock, we pitched camp by a spring and crawled into our tents for the second night.</p>
<p>Several hours and one tree-rimmed spring into the next day’s hike we turned up a fork to begin our exit. After a half-mile or so we turned again, following a set of human footprints up a side canyon. It was our one wrong turn of the trip, but with a simple map check we figured it out quickly and backtracked. On-the-ground navigation experience and a good map are what really count in canyon country. Even The Maze is manageable if you can read the terrain and check your map often. By sunset we had climbed out of the canyon and were making camp again, this time on a high plateau with views out across red-rock wilderness to the open sands and white-capped La Sals.</p>
<p>The sun had warmed a little section of slickrock that perfectly curved to the shape of our backs, and we leaned up against it, spreading our gear, looking out at a long slickrock point that extended to the edge of nowhere.</p>

<h6>A state park can be the best place to start, like Tannehill Ironworks State Park.<small> <a href=""http://bit.ly/2eNwTyD"">Rain0975</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Once you’ve picked a place for a day hike, you need to pick a particular trail or route. Many places have short trails that you can walk in less than an hour, as well as longer paths that will take you a few hours or most of a day. In addition, you’ll probably find that different trails with a variety of terrain, from flat ground to rolling hills to steep slopes. When you first start get into hiking, go for something that’s a littler easier and on the shorter side.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the types of people who will be hiking and what they can handle physically. If the hike will include kids, folks who are out of shape, or people with physical limitations, avoid strenuous trails with steep ups and downs. Some parks and other natural areas have maps that indicate the difficulty levels of certain trails, but you can also consult online guides and guidebooks, or get advice from a park ranger once you get there.</p>
<p>When you’re estimating what people can handle or how far they can hike, be conservative. First-time hikers often try to tackle more than they can handle, and they often don’t have a good idea of their pace. In general, you will probably be able to hike about 2-3 miles per hour, but your pace will slow considerably on trails with lots of hills.</p>
<h2>What to Wear</h2>
<h3>Dress in layers</h3>
<p>The key to staying comfortable outdoors is to avoid getting too hot or too cold. If you carry multiple layers, you can add or remove garments during your hike to adjust for changes in weather or your body temperature. Remember that you’re going to warm up quickly as your start hiking, so it’s okay to start out being a bit cool. If you hit the trail wearing all of your layers, you will probably get hot very quickly. You also have to take into consideration elevation (if applicable). The temperature can change about 5 degrees per 1,000 feet, so keep that in mind if you are going up from lower elevations for your hike.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: *Stash a lightweight waterproof jacket in your pack, just in case you get cold or unforeseeable weather rolls in.</p>
<h3>Ditch the cotton clothes</h3>
<p>In a humid place, you should avoid wearing any type of clothing made only of cotton, whether it’s underwear or a T-shirt. When cotton gets wet, it holds the moisture and takes a long time to dry, and in cold weather having damp clothes can rob you of body heat. Most outdoor clothing companies make items that blend cotton with synthetic materials or wool which will dry quickly and function well outdoors.</p>
<h3>Choosing the right shoes</h3>
<p>You don’t have to buy an expensive pair of hiking shoes, but wear something that provides good traction and stability on uneven ground with rocks and roots. Depending on the trail you choose, regular sneakers or trail shoes could work. If your ankles get injured easily, consider boots that rise above your ankles.</p>
<p>If you do go out and buy new hiking shoes made of thick leather or other stiff material, break them in gradually, rather than wearing the for the first time on a long hike (to prevent blisters).</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: While waterproof systems like Gore-Tex will keep out water, they don’t work well in high humidity, and the waterproof material will trap hot air and moisture in your footwear. Moisture on your feet = blisters.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Backpack</h2>
<p>Even if you are hiking just a few miles, a pack can be helpful in lightening your load. It also allows you to bring a couple extra items (like a jacket and gloves) just in case. For shorter day hikes, you won’t need anything too big—just enough for the basics. The most important feature is the fit, so make sure you try it on first. There are also packs designed specifically for men, women, and children, and packs that include hydration bladders with a tube that comes out of the pack and clips up by your shoulder, so you don’t even have to stop to get a drink.</p>
<h3>Other Gear</h3>
<p>For your first few hikes, you won’t need much else besides water and a snack or two, but as you get braver and want to venture out further, it could be helpful to pick up a few more things:</p>
<p>· First Aid Kit</p>
<p>· Headlamp</p>
<p>· Map or compass as a backup if your phone dies</p>
<p>· Multi-tool or knife</p>
<p>· Firestarter</p>
<h2>On the Trail</h2>
<h6>Make sure to break in your new hiking shoes before you go out on a hiking adventure.<small> Marcus Woolf</small>
</h6>
<h3>Hydrate</h3>
<p>One of the most important things you can do on the trail is to stay hydrated. Plan to carry all the water that you will need for the day—typically one or two quarts, depending on the weather (you might need more for hot, humid conditions). Don’t count on getting water from streams, unless you confirm that they’re flowing, and always filter or treat water taken from a natural source.</p>
<h3>Hiking with Kids</h3>
<p>If you’re going to hike with kids, get them involved in the planning to build up excitement, and get them a small backpack to carry some ""gear"", even if it’s just a water bottle and a snack.</p>
<p>When you hike with young kids, plan to go a relatively short distance. It’s pretty easy for kids to get worn out and bored, so, try to find a trail that gives you the goal of reaching something impressive, whether it’s a waterfall, cave, or other cool feature. If that’s not possible, make a list of things for the kids to find and do a scavenger during the hike, or go on a geocaching adventure—a hi-tech treasure hunt where you use a GPS or smartphone to locate a hidden object or container, known as a cache.</p>
<p>Because kids are unpredictable, it’s important to be flexible when hiking with them. If they don’t want to continue, you’re better off cutting the trip short, rather than forcing them to be miserable to reach some planned goal or destination.</p>
<h2>Staying Safe</h2>
<p>Above all else, you want to be safe and be able to have fun. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>· Check the weather and change your plans if necessary</p>
<p>· Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you should be back</p>
<p>· Don’t go out alone</p>
<p>· Take a whistle in case you need to signal for help</p>
<p>Stay on the trail and grab a map or take a picture of the trailhead before you set out</p>

<div><p>People inspire me. I love comedy for its ability to reach across different types of people and crazy things going on and still bring laughter.

<p><em>Practical reminders, common sense approaches and clever solutions to avoid everyday challenges and live your best life. </em></p>
<hr>
<p>We have many senses to experience the world around us: sight, hearing, taste and so on. But did you ever consider your feet to be a sensory organ? We sense the ground beneath us through our feet. They support us and carry us through the world, so they deserve special care. When your feet are happy, the structure of your entire body is happy. Follow these simple steps to keep your feet healthy.</p>
<h3>Wear the Right Shoes</h3>
<p>You've undoubtedly heard many stories about <a href=""http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-living/wellbeing/a26805/shoes-affect-you-health/"">discomfort caused</a> by poorly fitting shoes. Years of wearing improper footwear can lead to or exacerbate many foot problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foot deformities like bunions and hammertoes</li>
<li>Corns and calluses</li>
<li>Ingrown toenails</li>
<li>Foot pain from conditions like plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, neuromas (painful nerve enlargements) and tendonitis</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not just your feet that suffer from shoes that don't fit. Poor fit leads to poor support, which in turn can lead to poor posture. What happens in your feet can resonate upward through your legs and torso, so it's no surprise that a lot of muscle and joint pain, back pain and even neck pain can be related to shoe fit.</p>
<h3>How to Choose Shoes</h3>
<p>Your shoes must have enough room for your toes to move freely. Good heel and arch support are also a must. Unfortunately, most of the features of high fashion shoes (i.e. stiletto heels, pointy toes) don't meet these requirements. That doesn't mean you can never wear these type of shoes. Just limit the amount of time you wear them, and rotate your shoes so you aren't constantly in the same pair. Also consider using <a href=""../../../../en-us/"">insoles</a> designed specifically for the structure of your foot and the type of shoe (there are even <a href=""../../../../../en-us/insoles-and-sandals?filter=womens,insoles"">supportive insoles made  for high-heeled shoes</a>). Another tip: when shopping for new shoes, do so at the end of the day because your feet typically swell slightly by afternoon.</p>
<h5>
<img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/feb_b_02-en-1519923610.jpg""><br>Shop the shoes pictured above <a href=""../../../../../en-us/insoles-and-sandals/beech"">here</a>.</h5>
<p><br>People who participate in sporting activities are already familiar with the wide-ranging choice of athletic footwear. If you engage in one or two activities regularly, such as running, hiking or playing basketball, be sure you wear shoes and insoles specifically designed for your sport. You will save yourself a world of foot trouble.</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/feb_b_03-en-1519923645.jpg""></p>
<p>And if you choose to wear flip flops on a daily basis (we’re looking at you, California), be sure they too are the style of <a href=""../../../../../en-us/insoles-and-sandals?filter=footwear,new-products"">sandals with ample shape and support.</a></p>
<h3>How to Take Care of Your Feet</h3>
<p><br>Wearing shoes keeps your feet protected and warm, but that also means they're susceptible to bacterial and fungal growth like toenail infections and athlete's foot. Your feet have hundreds of thousand of <a href=""https://www.foot.com/foot-facts/"">sweat glands</a>; all that perspiration and warmth creates a perfect environment for infections to multiply.</p>
<p>Take these steps to ward off nasty fungi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean your feet thoroughly and be sure they are completely dry, especially between the toes, before you put on socks and footwear.</li>
<li>If you have particularly sweaty feet, use foot powder and change your socks several times a day. This should also help control foot odor.</li>
<li>Choose socks and shoes that let your feet breathe. Look for socks made of synthetic fibers that wick moisture away and shoes made of leather, canvas or mesh.</li>
<li>Anytime you use a gym, locker room or public pool, wear shower shoes to avoid picking up a fungal or bacterial infection.</li>
<li>Don't share footwear, especially rentals.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/feb_b_04-en-1519923851.jpg""></p>
<p>The two most important things you can do to make your feet happy are to wear shoes and insoles that support and fit properly, and to keep your feet clean and dry. Such simple things with the potential result of a lifetime of happy, healthy feet. Worth it? Absolutely!</p>

"589639450807","10-best-hikes-in-boulder","MERGE","10 Best Hikes in Boulder","Superfeet","<p>From Boulder’s highest peaks, the amazing landscape that has shaped the Rocky Mountains presents itself in two different worlds. To the east, the land is a flat, tawny expanse of sprawling prairie that meets the sky in a perfectly horizontal horizon. In contrast, western views look out onto the snow-capped mountains of the Front Range, a collection of summits that alternate between massive, rounded domes and harsh, jagged spires. Boulder’s foothills serve as altars between these geographic marvels, transitioning from the high plains to the first uplifted contours of America’s most famous mountain range.</p>
<p>Here are 10 hikes that showcase the beauty and diversity found in Boulder’s wilderness.</p>
<h2>1. Green Mountain</h2>
<h6>The summit marker on Green Mountain identifies distant peaks. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>At 8,150 feet, Green Mountain is one of a trio of peaks that extend above the city’s famous Flatiron rock towers. There are several trails to Green’s summit with the most popular routes starting at Gregory Canyon. The Amphitheater Trail begins with an abrupt stone staircase that bypasses the namesake rock alcove before heading up through pine forests, where semi-open views preclude the amazing 360° views from the summit. Also starting from Gregory Canyon is the Gregory Canyon Trail, which follows more open rock outcrops than the Amphitheater and remains scarred from the 2013 floods that reshaped many of Boulder’s trails. A sturdy stone cairn topped with a brass plate identifying the distant summits is mounted on the summit boulder.</p>
<h2>2. Bear Peak</h2>
<h6>Bear Peak on a perfect winter’s day. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>There are two fantastic routes up the 8,460-foot Bear Peak, both starting from the NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) parking lot—they can be combined to form an excellent loop. From NCAR, head to the Mesa Trail then up Fern Canyon. This trail follows the shadowy, steep canyon and is made more mysterious by the dark caves and askew boulders that line the trail. After a steady climb, the iron-rich spine of red rock that makes up Bear Peak’s exposed summit comes into view. A brief but thrilling scramble leads to the top, where boulder’s most open summit views await. Descend via the West Ridge Trail through the spooky remnants of a burn zone that fades into lush alpine meadows before reconnecting with the Mesa Trail, closing the loop.</p>
<h2>3. South Boulder Peak</h2>
<h6>The summit of South Boulder Peak. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>South Boulder Peak is the highest point in the Boulder Mountain Parks region (8,549 ft.) yet isn’t as popular a hike as its neighboring summits of Green Mountain and Bear Peak. Fewer crowds means that hikers often have the summit boulders to themselves. Views to the east are hindered by pine trees but are open and glorious to the west. There are also pockets of wild raspberry bushes near the summit. Linking Bear Peak and South Boulder peak only takes about 30 minutes and the two mountains share a common trailhead at Shadow Canyon/South Mesa Trailhead. For a robust day, hiking all three mountains (South Boulder-Bear-Green) is a classic adventure both as a loop and as a point-to-point from South Mesa Trailhead to Gregory Canyon.</p>
<h2>4. Mount Sanitas</h2>
<p>If Boulder were to designate a hometown mountain, Sanitas would be it. It can be a busy place on summer weekends when hikers, joggers, canine companions, and photographers converge on the modest 6,843-foot peak. The addition of the smoothly-graded Lion’s Lair Trail in 2014 from the western approach in Sunshine Canyon has helped disperse foot traffic on the mountain (not to mention adding one of the best trail running paths in the city). The east side trails from Linden Avenue and Mapleton Avenue are steep, sturdy, and scenic. The access is easy, the views are spectacular, and a round-trip hike can be done in just over an hour—or longer if you want to make a loop. Settlers Park, Boulder’s Red Rocks Park, and nearby Pearl Street are all a short distance from Mount Sanitas.</p>
<h2>5. Marshall Mesa</h2>
<h6>Marshall Mesa during spring thaw. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>Rather than offering airy summit views, Marshall Mesa’s eastern locale affords it some of the very best, wide-open views of Boulder’s iconic landmarks from the vantage point of the plains. Along its easy, rolling trails are optimal vistas of the Flatirons to the west. To the north, views of the city and Boulder Valley sprawl to the foothills and off in the far distance, Longs Peak looms. Marshall Mesa is a peaceful place to admire Boulder from afar and it can be accessed by two main trailheads off CO 93: Marshall Mesa Trailhead and the Greenbelt Plateau Trailhead. Keep an eye out for the local coyote population!</p>
<h2>6. Sage Trail</h2>

</h6>
<p>Located on the outskirts of north Boulder, this three-mile loop harkens back to the city’s agrarian roots. The Sage Trail circles the Boulder Valley Ranch, a still working farm in the middle of open space. Views of the city to the south are blocked by a small mesa, making it feel like you are much farther away from the commotion of urban life than you actually are. Old cottonwood trees line the irrigation ditch that opens up to the grassy meadows, where cows and horses meander. Those looking to increase their mileage can walk via the Eagle Trail and dirt roads to Boulder Reservoir or detour up to the mesa itself.</p>
<h2>7. Sugarloaf Mountain</h2>
<h6>There are so many options for hiking in Boulder and all of the trails have unbeatable views. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>Sugarloaf Mountain is roughly 20 minutes from downtown Boulder up Boulder Canyon in the unincorporated part of the county. The round-trip hiking mileage is a mere two miles from the parking area at the start of the Switzerland Trail but the views from the 8,917-foot summit are well-worth a visit From this western vantage point, the trio of high peaks in town (Green-Bear-South Boulder) appear as pine-covered hills. Sugarloaf’s summit is rocky and barren but still inviting. Views into Four Mile Canyon and Boulder Canyon reflect the 2010 wildfires that scarred the landscape.<br><br></p>

<h2>
<br>8. Dowdy Draw/Flatirons Vista</h2>
<h6>Great views of the Flatirons from the Dowdy Draw trail <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>Dowdy Draw and Flatirons Vista are connected by a trail that starts near the base of Eldorado Canyon and eventually connects (via an underpass or crossing the road) to Marshall Mesa. Dowdy Draw sees less traffic than the neighboring South Mesa Trail, though some of that is in the form of mountain bikers. Nevertheless, a hike starting at Dowdy Draw treks through grassy meadows and climbs up to a spacious pine forest, eventually looping to the Flatirons Vista Trailhead on highway 93. A round-trip adventure is about six miles, though there are other trails to connect and detour along. This area is especially pleasing during the winter months, when there are fewer hikers and the wildlife (coyotes, bear, and even mountain lion) are out and about.</p>
<h2>9. Red Rocks/Anemone Trail</h2>
<h6>A warm but snowy hike up the Anemone Trail. <small> James Dziezynski </small>
</h6>
<p>Boulder’s version of Red Rocks isn’t the famous outdoors music theater, rather, it’s a nifty outcrop that is a short 0.2 mile hike from the Centennial Trailhead. The rocks are fun to scramble on and offer nice views of the city to the east. Sharing the same trailhead is the Anemone Trail, a lesser-used trail that heads to the top of the 6,423-foot Anemone Hill, a sister peak of sorts to the more popular Mount Sanitas. Due to damage from wildfires in 2013, the access trails have been intermittently closed as crews re-rerouted the hiking paths but as of 2016, these trails are all reopened.</p>
<h2>10. Walker Ranch</h2>
<h6>Walker Ranch. <small> Jack Sasson </small>
</h6>
<p>Walker Ranch is a 7.6 -mile loop located about 20 miles west of Chautauqua Park up and over Flagstaff Road. The trail can be hiked in either direction and starts near the highest point of the route. Descend to South Boulder Creek before encountering a steep, 200-foot tall stone staircase near the halfway point of the trail. There are burn zones, open meadows, and quiet forests to explore along the way. It’s also a good place to see the western faces of Bear and South Boulder Peaks.</p>

<p>Signing up for your first marathon is an exhilarating moment. You’re excited at the prospect of taking on the event, which is probably still far enough away that the actual challenges involved don’t seem too daunting. You have ages to train for it, after all.</p>
<p>Once you’re into the long period of marathon training, however, you quickly realise that the challenge of the marathon isn’t so much the 42.2km you run on race day as the hundreds of kilometres you cover in training.</p>
<p>It’s essential, therefore, to ensure you pace your training correctly so you don’t burn out long before race day itself.It’s essential, therefore, to ensure you pace your training correctly so you don’t burn out long before race day itself. Check out these invaluable marathon training tips from Tom Craggs, a running coach and Loch Ness Marathon ambassador – you’ll find his suggestions mirrored in any top-quality training plan.</p>
<h2>1. Start With Regular Running</h2>
<p>“If life allows, aim for small and regular runs in the early weeks of training,” says Craggs. “Four to five short runs will be better than two long efforts with nothing in between.”</p>
<h2>2. Build Up The Length Of Your Long Run Slowly</h2>
<p>The long Sunday run is key to marathon success, but there’s no need to go for broke early on.</p>
<p>“Build patiently and slowly, and add ten to 15 minutes maximum each week,” says Craggs. “In the early weeks focus on completing these runs at a relaxed and conversational pace. Then, if you feel good, try to get used to increasing your pace for the final 30-40 minutes of your run.”</p>
<h2>3. Plan Ahead</h2>
<p>“Track back from race day and plan in your key long runs three to eight weeks before your event,” says Craggs. “Get organised and structure your training week in advance to ensure you are running at times when you have the best chance of completing the sessions and feel most energised. Plan to take at least one full rest day each week and line up a slightly lighter week every three to four weeks.”</p>
<h2>4. Use Your Midweek Runs Wisely</h2>
<p>Often first-time marathoners drift through any midweek runs they do, with all the focus on the long run they face that weekend, but the right kind of run on a Tuesday or Wednesday can reap as many gains as your Sunday session.</p>
<p>“Try a 45- to 60-minute run that includes five sets of five minutes running at a pace where you can only speak three or four words at a time, jogging for 90 seconds between each effort,” says Craggs. “Aim to build this up over the weeks to six sets of five-minute efforts, three sets of ten minutes, or even 20-25 minutes as a solid block.”</p>
<h2>5. Race</h2>
<p>Don’t just practise running, practise racing too. Sign up for a few races throughout your plan and you have some short-term goals that can help to break up your training and make it seem less like one long slog. It also helps you to refine your race day routine so you’re not tripped up unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“Aim to book in a half marathon five to six weeks before your marathon,” says Craggs. “You could either run this hard, looking for a personal best, or turn it into a long run by adding a couple of miles before and after, and running the race at goal marathon pace. If you can’t get into a half consider running a parkrun every three to four weeks – this can be great for testing your fitness.”</p>
<h2>6. Don’t Just Run On Pavements</h2>
<p>“Running on different surfaces such as grass and trails will help prevent injury, and also help build strength and balance,” says Craggs. “Consider also mixing your running with other forms of cardiovascular exercise such as cycling, swimming or using an elliptical trainer. This will still give your heart and lungs a workout, without the joint impact of running. “</p>
<h2>7. Learn How To Run Easy</h2>
<p>In some training runs you’ll aim to push yourself, but a lot of the time should be spent running easy. Pushing too hard on these runs is how you burn out.</p>
<p>“If you find yourself short of breath and feeling like you need to stop after four to five minutes you are simply running too hard,” says Craggs. “Try to stick at the ‘speed of chat’ to get yourself working and enjoying your running. Don’t worry if you need to mix running and walking in the early weeks. Aim to keep the pace of your running easy and gradually reduce your walking breaks as the weeks progress.”</p>
<h2>8. Strengthen Your Core</h2>
<p>“Runners who are more robust and who can hold their posture and technique even when tired tend to perform better on marathon day,” says Craggs. “Getting into a good routine of two to three short core sessions a week is a great goal in the early weeks of training. For the more experienced doing squat, deadlift, lunge, row and press-up exercises can be a great addition to your training.”</p>
<h2>9. Run With Others</h2>
<p>“Surround yourself with positive people and look to train with friends or family sharing the same goal,” says Craggs. “If none do, then you can join a local running club. Having a group to motivate and support each other will help keep you out running when it gets tough!”</p>
<h2>10. Log Your Training</h2>
<p>“Getting your training down on paper, or on screen, can be a great way of monitoring your progress and having accountability,” says Craggs. “Aim to note down two to three positives from your training every week, plus a couple of priorities to develop for the following week. When you look back at your training before the marathon you’ll have a big bank of positivity to review!”</p>
<h2>11. Eat And Sleep Well</h2>
<p>“Focus on high-quality nutrition with a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables, and adequate amounts of protein,” says Craggs. “To improve sleep, aim to get off your phone in the final 90 minutes before bed. Creating a good pre-bed routine can improve the quality of your sleep, which is when many of the positive adaptations to training occur.”</p>

"589639385271","15-of-the-most-iconic-hikes-in-the-world","MERGE","15 of the Most Iconic Hikes in the World","Superfeet","<p>The planet is crisscrossed with epic trails, from the Alps to the Andes. There are snowy summit trips for fleet-footed peak-baggers, long and leisurely rambles for wildlife lovers, and everything in between. While the options are almost infinite, here are a few epic hikes to add to that ever-expanding life list.</p>
<h2>1. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</h2>
<div><iframe src=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BfNv2o4AGen/embed/captioned""></iframe></div>
<p>One of the planet’s Seven Summits, 19,341-foot Kilimanjaro is the highest freestanding mountain on Earth—and Africa’s loftiest peak. Despite the distinction, the glaciated summit is accessible courtesy of a number of a non-technical routes, leading climbers through five distinctly different climate zones. On the path to Uhuru Peak, trekkers traverse a lowland rainforest inhabited by colobus and blue monkeys, ascend the scrubby montane moorland of the Shira Plateau, cross hulking glaciers, and catch glimpses of the megafauna-loaded grasslands of Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. At basecamp, vividly colored tents dot an unearthly moonscape, and climbers rest in the shadow of toothy 16,893-foot Mawenzi.</p>
<h2>2. Table Mountain, South Africa</h2>
<p>While the flat-topped mesa soaring above Cape Town is accessible by cable-car, the climb to the apex of 3,569-foot <a href=""https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/"">Table Mountain</a> is one of the planet’s most spectacular treks—and a must-do for a visit to this dynamic city. Routes to the top of the 500 million-year-old massif treat ascending climbers to panoramic vistas of the pointed peaks of the Twelve Apostles, the azure water of Camps Bay, knobby Lion’s Head, and Cape Town’s bustling City Bowl. There are plenty of half-day routes to the mesa’s highest point, Maclear’s Beacon, including the three-hour slog through Skeleton Gorge, allowing hikers to encounter Cape dwarf chameleons, stealthy caracals, and vibrantly colored sunbirds. The climb can also be done as a multi-day trip along the Cape of Good Hope Trail or the Hoerikwaggo Trail, beginning at Cape Point.</p>
<h2>3. Te Araroa Trail, New Zealand</h2>
<p>Meaning ""the long pathway,"" in Maori, New Zealand’s 1,864-mile <a href=""https://www.teararoa.org.nz/"">Te Araroa Trail</a> is the Kiwi version of America’s Appalachian Trail. Bookended by the Pacific Ocean, between Cape Regina and Bluff, the route runs through the heart of New Zealand, traversing both North and South islands and leading backpackers through a staggering diversity of landscapes: sun-drenched coastlines, subtropical rainforests, snow-dusted alpine passes, and river-braided glacial valleys. The epic trek also showcases many of New Zealand’s geological gems, including the Southern Alps, famed backdrop for the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, and the still-active Tongariro volcano.</p>
<h2>4. Annapurna Circuit, Nepal</h2>
<p>Besides Everest, the most idolized Himalayan foray is Nepal’s Annapurna Circuit. The nearly 130-mile route horseshoes the Annapurna range’s sea of glaciated summits, capped by 26,545-foot Annapurna I. The high-altitude tour takes hardy trekkers through highlands terraced with rice paddies, across surging whitewater rivers, through shadowy rhododendron forests, over otherworldly mountain passes, and past Buddhist gompas and Hindu shrines. While backpackers on the circuit must tackle challenges like 17,768-foot Thorung La, the route is dotted with cozy tea houses affording creature comforts like brief but heavenly hot showers and steaming plates of <em>dal bhat</em>, a traditional meal of steamed rice and cooked lentil soup.</p>
<h2>5. John Muir Trail, California</h2>
<p>Named for legendary naturalist and founder of the Sierra Club, the John Muir Trail strings together two of California’s most spectacular natural wonders: the Yosemite Valley and 14,496-foot Mount Whitney, the highest point in the continental United States. Tracing the spine of the High Sierra, the 211-mile route moseys through three national parks and two federally designated wildernesses, leading hikers through a landscape of high peaks and passes, glassy alpine lakes, and sun-drenched mountain meadows. The trail skirts Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, and showcases natural wonders like the Devil’s Postpile National Monument and Evolution Basin in Kings Canyon National Park. Plus, hikers have ample opportunity to encounter black bears, mule deer, and curious marmots along the route.</p>
<h2>6. Four Pass Loop, Colorado</h2>
<p>The most photographed spot in Colorado, the snow-stripped twin peaks of the Maroon Bells are best celebrated on the epic <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/whiteriver/recreation/recarea/?recid=40555&amp;actid=43"">Four Pass Loop</a> through the <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/whiteriver/recarea/?recid=81118"">Maroon Bells/Snowmass Wilderness</a>. The aptly amed 26-mile circuit begins at turquoise-toned Maroon Lake, just west of Aspen, and takes backpackers over four alpine passes each higher than 12,000 feet, across airy meadows dusted with wildflowers, through spruce forests and copses of white-barked aspen, and past backcountry waterfalls and peak-framed lakes. Besides the Maroon Bells, the Elk Mountains sampler also provides trekkers the chance to gape at a handful of celestial fourteeners, including Pyramid Peak and Snowmass Mountain.</p>
<h2>7. Beara Way, Ireland</h2>
<p>Ringing Ireland’s wind-pummeled Beara Peninsula, a 48-mile sliver of land bisected by the Caha and Slieve Miskish mountains, the <a href=""http://bearatourism.com/bearaway.html"">Beara Way</a> provides a quintessential taste of the Emerald Isle and forms part of Ireland’s longest hiking trail, the Beara-Breifne Way. The 122-mile trek cobbles together bucolic country lanes, highland tracks, and ancient roads, offering a glimpse of the peninsula’s colorful past. Following the path taken by Beara’s last chieftain, Donal Cam O’Sullivan Beare, as he fled hotly pursuing Elizabethan troops in 1603, the Beara Way takes trekkers past Neolithic and Bronze Age sites, through charming towns, and over craggy highlands. Fortunately, the lung-taxing climbs and knee-grating descents are greeted with panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline, including the shimmering waters of Bantry Bay, staging point for Theobald Wolfe Tone’s infamous but ill-fated 1786 rebellion.</p>
<h2>8. Cotopaxi, Ecuador</h2>
<p>One of the peaks in Ecuador’s Avenue of Volcanoes, 19,347-foot Cotopaxi soars above the high Andean páramo of <a href=""https://www.ambiente.gob.ec/parque-nacional-cotopaxi/"">Cotopaxi National Park</a>. Although the peak is the second highest in Ecuador—and one of the loftiest active volcanoes on the planet—Cotopaxi is scalable without prior mountaineering experience. Ropes, crampons, and ice axes are required to reach the snow-capped pinnacle, but with the help of local guides (and after a quick hands-on introduction to mountaineering), the crater-pocked peak is reachable for most reasonably fit trekkers. Along the way to the summit, hikers have the chance to spot wild horses, llamas, and spectacled bears (the ursine species credited with inspiring the fictional character Paddington).</p>
<h2>9. Inca Trail, Peru</h2>
<div><iframe src=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BfOPtDRFW7D/embed/captioned""></iframe></div>
<p>The most celebrated trek in South America, this Andean excursion takes hikers from the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu, the stone-hewn urban center crafted by the Incas during the 15th century, a World Heritage site since 1983. Along the way to Machu Picchu, the 24-mile trek follows paths forged by the Incas more than 500 years ago, meandering through cloud forests studded with 300 types of orchids, over three cloud-shrouded mountain passes, and past pre-Columbian ruins. Stashed away at 7,972 feet, the <a href=""https://www.cultura.gob.pe/patrimonio/sitiosdepatrimoniomundial/listapatrimoniomundialperu/santuariomachupicchu"">Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu</a> is also a biodiversity hotspot, serving as an ecological corridor linking the Andes, Sacred Valley, and Amazon, and affording trekkers the opportunity to spot 370 different types of bird, including mammoth Andean condors.</p>
<h2>10. Mount Kinabalu, Malaysia</h2>
<p>Soaring above other peaks in Malaysian Borneo’s Crocker Range, 13,435-foot <a href=""https://www.sabahparks.org.my/index.php/the-parks/kinabalu-park"">Mount Kinabalu</a> is the loftiest summit in Southeast Asia. <em>Gunung Kinabalu</em>, as the peak is known in Malay, is also the country’s first World Heritage site, a global hotspot for flora and fauna. The mountain’s ecosystems harbor more than 5,000 types of plants, over 300 species of birds, and 100 different mammals. Along the path to the granite-tipped summit, which typically takes two to three days round-trip, lush lowland rainforests give way to cloud-bathed montane and coniferous forests, providing the chance to spot orangutans, Bornean gibbons, and long-tailed Bornean Treepies. The mountain’s six different vegetation zones also support a thousand different orchids and five endemic species of carnivorous pitcher plants, including the largest on earth, <em>Nepenthes rajah</em>.</p>
<h2>11. Tour du Mont Blanc, Western Europe</h2>
<div><iframe src=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BenyuU0hIrB/embed/captioned""></iframe></div>
<p>While scaling 15,781-foot Mont Blanc requires extensive mountaineering knowhow, more casual hikers can still get an eyeful of Western Europe’s loftiest summit from three different countries—France, Italy, and Switzerland—on the Tour du Mont Blanc. The 105-mile route rings the entire snow-frosted massif, traipsing over seven alpine passes, past storybook alpine hamlets, along colossal glaciers, and through wildflower-freckled meadows. Besides the spellbinding scenery, the Tour du Mont Blanc also provides a snapshot of regional culture, taking hikers through historic locales like medieval Courmayeur. Best of all, while physically taxing, the route is scattered with cozy alpine huts, affording plenty of opportunity to swap freeze-dried fare for fondue.</p>
<h2>12. Torres del Paine Circuit, Patagonia, Chile</h2>
<p>Towering above the guanaco-grazed steppes of Chilean Patagonia, the trio of granite pillars dubbed Torres del Paine comprise one of the most iconic massifs on earth. The blue-hued granite cathedral tops out at 10,656 feet and crowns <a href=""https://www.conaf.cl/parques/parque-nacional-torres-del-paine/"">Torres del Paine National Park</a>, a former sheep estancia declared a World Heritage site in 1978. Backpackers can gape at the granite monoliths from every angle imaginable along on a circuit trek on the national park’s non-technical trails. The more heavily trafficked ‘W’ configuration can be done in less than four days, while the more extensive ‘O’ circuit, takes about a week. Despite the rugged landscape of glaciated granite peaks, raging rivers, and iceberg-strewn alpine lakes, the Torres del Paine circuit can be done without forgoing creature comforts by cobbling together a route linking the park’s cozy <em>refugios</em>.</p>
<h2>13. Kalalau Trail, Hawaii</h2>
<p>Showcasing Kauai’s rugged <a href=""https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/kauai/napali-coast-state-wilderness-park/"">Nā Pali Coast</a>, where fluted mountains meld into the glistening Pacific Ocean, the Kalalau Trail is among the most spectacular coastal treks on earth. But, the 11-mile trek is no walk on the beach. Between Ke’e Beach and Kalalau Beach, the trail winds through five different valleys, across more than a half-dozen streams, and along precipitous cliff sides, including a vertiginous stretch aptly dubbed Crawler’s Ledge, for the hikers duly daunted by the 500-foot drop. Grit and determination are mandatory, but trekkers are rewarded with jaw-dropping views of the Pacific and gems like the 300-foot Hanakapi’ai Waterfall. While the 22-mile out-and-back trip can be done in a day, the route is scattered with stunning camping spots, like the area near 1,400-foot Hanakoa Falls, about halfway through the trek.</p>
<h2>14. Mount Fuji, Japan</h2>
<p>Located southwest of Tokyo, the solitary summit of 12,388-foot <a href=""https://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/"">Mount Fuji</a> is one of the planet’s most recognizable peaks. Dormant for just over 300 years, the snow-dusted stratovolcano has served as an artistic muse for centuries, revered as one of Japan’s Three Holy Mountains. Religious pilgrims have been scaling the sacred mountain since ancient times, and the climb remains exceedingly popular. Climbing season for Mount Fuji only runs from the beginning of July to the end of August, but more than 300,000 trekkers make the approximately six-hour trip every year. While there are celestial views on the way to the summit, the trek has the distinction of being one of the few climbs on the planet that is more cultural experience than wilderness excursion. Each of the four routes to the top offers mountain huts peddling food and drinks, and there is even a post office at the summit where you can drop a postcard to a lucky recipient.</p>
<h2>15. Sunshine Coast Trail, British Columbia</h2>
<div><iframe src=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Be_7CUBBJzE/embed/captioned""></iframe></div>
<p>Rambling along the wild Sunshine Coast in southwest British Columbia, the <a href=""https://sunshinecoast-trail.com/"">Sunshine Coast Trail</a> is a less-frequented alternative to the <a href=""https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/activ6a"">West Coast Trail</a>. Built entirely by volunteers and maintained by the non-profit <a href=""https://sunshinecoast-trail.com/prpaws/"">Powell River Parks and Wilderness Society</a>, the 112-mile trail ambles from Desolation Sound to Saltery Bay, taking trekkers through old growth rainforests roamed by black bears, grey wolves, and cougars. Wildlife watchers also have the chance to spot the blubbery bodies of Stellar sea lions and harbor seals along coastal stretches of the trail, and the route’s highest point—4,821-foot Mount Troutbridge—is a hotspot for seafaring marbled murrelets. Best of all, the Sunshine Coast Trail is Canada’s only free hut-to-hut track, with no reservations or permits required.</p>

<p>At times, the <a href=""http://www.grandfather.com/things-to-do/walking-hiking/backcountry-hiking/crest-trails/#grandfather"">Grandfather Trail</a> may feel more like an obstacle course than a hiking path. An intricate series of ladders, walkways, and steel cables zig-zag up and across the three seperate peaks of Grandfather Mountain. This is an out-and-back trail, featuring 2.4 miles of hoisting, scrambling, and hand-over-hand climbing each direction. The route edges along the crest of the mountain, ducking through stunted spruce trees and skirting across exposed rock faces.  The views from the first two peaks are astonishing, but the true reward lies at the top of the third and tallest summit, 5,946 ft Calloway Peak. Come and see why John Muir once described Grandfather Mountain as ""the face of all heaven come to earth.""</p>

<h4>2. CRABTREE FALLS</h4>

<p><sup><sub>Crabtree Falls on a crisp fall day <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/mblouir/"">Matthew Blouir</a></sub></sup></p>
<p>Even before coming in site of the waterfall, visitors to Crabtree Meadows are captivated by the lush carpet of wildflowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The forest floor is awash with over forty varieties of flowers, creating a bejeweled background for the popular <a href=""http://www.hikewnc.info/besthikes/blue-ridge-parkway-section-3/crabtree-falls"">Crabtree Falls Trail</a>. This 2.4 mile loop begins with a series of switchbacks, gently descending to the base of its namesake falls: a wispy white curtain of water cascading over a 70 foot beehive of dark rock. The remaining 1.5 miles climb out of the enchanted forest through creeks and over split-log bridges.</p>

<h4>3. LOOKING GLASS ROCK</h4>

<p><a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/looking-glass-rock-hiking"">Looking Glass Rock</a>  is a steep granite monolith, rising like a cargo ship from the rolling waves of Pisgah National Forest. The trail to the top, however, is surprisingly benign; while certainly a challenge, the constant switchbacks really take the edge of the steep gradient. The single trail etched into the mountainside is an out-and-back that makes for a journey totaling 6.4 miles. The summit of Looking Glass is an anomaly in the Blue Ridge: flat-topped, thickly forested, and not particularly tall. In fact, you'll be gazing up at the mountains that engulf you, not down upon them. It is the exposure factor, the thrill of standing on the edge of a sheer vertical drop off, that make this one of the most thrilling and popular hikes in the region.</p>

<p>The Old Mitchell Trail leads you to the summit of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/mt-mitchell-on-top-of-the-east"">Mt. Mitchell</a> , the highest peak East of the Mississippi River. From that lofty perch, surrounded by sky, immersed in chilled mountain air, allow yourself ample time to sit back and observe the world from one and a quarter miles above sea level. There are many options that lead to the top, and Old Mitchell is a classic: a four-mile loop with an out and back extension to the summit, and every step is above 6,000 feet! You'll encounter the typical backcountry obstacles: a relentless climb gnarled with roots, rocks, and raspberry cane. However, to reach the top and be engulfed in a world of rippled Appalachian peaks, standing high above them all, is an experience that no hiker should miss.</p>

<p>Perched high in the Great Balsam Range, the glittering quartz formations at the summit of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/shining-rock"">Shining Rock</a> make for a gorgeous and unusual spectacle. The bright swirling rock, emerging like frozen ocean waves from a dark coniferous forest and surrounded by soaring mountain views, creates a scene so lovely and dramatic it appears almost otherworldly. A section of the  <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/backpacking-camping/art-loeb-trail"">Art Loeb Trail</a> , beginning at the Black Balsam parking area and meandering over a series of grassy balds is particularly exquisite way to reach ""the crystalline cliffs.""</p>

<p>The picturesque summit of  <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/waterrock-knob"">Waterrock knob</a>  is a mere half mile from the parking area, but don't even dream of writing it off as a roadside attraction. With breathtaking views and readily accessible ridge hiking unspooling in both directions, Watterrock is the perfect jumping off point for exploring the Plott Balsam Range. The wide, grassy meadow at the start of the summit hike may be the most dramatic locale for a family picnic on the entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway. To claim the best view possible, sneak past the summit onto a rock outcropping on the Southern side of the peak, and behold the lush Tuckasegee River Valley and the Nantahala National Forest spread out below, the Great Smoky Mountains unfurling into the distance.</p>

<p>The Blue Ridge Parkway delivers you nearly to the pinnacle of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/hiking/craggy-gardens"">Craggy Gardens</a> , a heath bald of grey rock and pink-blooming rhododendron that soars 5,892 feet above sea level. At the summit, high-mountain grasses wave placidly in the foreground, set against panoramic mountain views. The trail is 1.4 miles round-trip and climbs only 252 feet in elevation: a huge payoff for minimal exertion. Cool tunnels of mountain laurel, twisted birch trees, and the occasional lookout make for an enjoyable journey as you meander to the top.</p>

<h4>8. HAWKSBILL MOUNTAIN</h4>

<p>The rocky summit of Hawksbill Mountain affords one of the most spectacular views in all of North Carolina. Two thousand feet below you, the Linville River threads through the bottom of the canyon, enveloped by nearly 12,000 acres of unadulterated wilderness. Grandfather Mountain, Table Rock, and Shortoff Mountain cut stately profiles against the peak-rippled horizon. This three-mile loop features a steep climb on the way up and a gentler, more gradual descent. The trail is accessible from Forest Service Road 1264 in Pisgah National Forest. Be aware that this road is closed from January-March.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder that <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/knoxville-tn/hiking/max-patch"">Max Patch Meadow</a> is considered the most gorgeous section of the entire Appalachian Trail. The summit is rounded and soft with grass, surrounded by rolling woods and pastureland that gradually swell into mountains, eventually becoming the sharp peaks of the Black Mountain Range, Blue Ridge, and the Smokies in the distance. Although the summit is only a few minutes walk from the parking area, jump on the Appalachian Trail for a day trip to Lemon Gap—or hike all the way to Maine, for that matter!</p>

The view from up top is more intimate than the typical Appalachian vista. A series of peaks affectionately known as The Seven Sisters of the Black Mountain Range feel so close, it's as if you could reach out and touch them. To add an extra hour to your hike, and to escape the crowds that can converge on the small rocky summit, descend via the East Ridge Trail. This leads to the Blue Gap Trail, which will bring you back to the parking lot.</p>

Whether you're a hardcore peak bagger, out for an ambitious day hike, or are obsessed with the panoramic views for your Instagram feed, there's always something thrilling to lace your hiking boots up for. Here, we tapped RootsRated editors for intel on some of the best hikes in the United States. Use them as inspiration for your next outing—or as a reason to plan a trip.</p>
<h2>Teton Crest Trail, Wyoming</h2>
<h6>The Teton Crest Trail epitomizes the splendor of the West. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/dB7rRf"">John Strother</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>There are a lot of really great hikes on this list, but Wyoming's <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/jackson-hole-wy/backpacking-camping/teton-crest-trail"">Teton Crest Trail</a> might just take the cake as being the most epic. For 35-45 miles (depending on your route), this slender singletrack path cuts a dwarfed, serpentine figure as it slices through the heart of one of America's most stunning mountain ranges, linking together its very best features along the way. Over the course of two to five days, hikers will pass through wildflower-filled meadows, over airy mountain passes, past glacially-fed tarns, and across expansive basins that swallow up hikers and spit them out as tiny, inconsequential specks against the jagged backdrop of the Tetons. In short, this trail will skew your perception of what constitutes a bucket-list worthy hike. Pro tip: Permits are hard to come by, but because the trail weaves in and out of national parklands and national forestlands, if you camp in national forest designated areas, obtaining a permit isn't necessary.</p>
<h2>Roan Mountain, Tennessee</h2>
<h6>The 14-mile traverse of the Roan Mountain Highlands is one of the best hikes in the Southeast. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/28744394@N08/7283458326/in/photolist-c6BCpG-c6BCZN-c6BC9L-c6BDGU-c6BDTb-c6BCyE-c6BEdU-c6BFbY-ha61i-ha7R5-9Uv4HK-9UuZM8-cg5BZ7-cg5tWA-cg5APb-cg5ybb-cg5wDd-cg5zKu-cg5vkd-cg5xrU-cg5yXo-nJeNEs-9tsMpp-zPXXvz-zMWdkm-zwrpoQ-zMWdvm-zwxiEn-zwroNG-9Uv2mx-zwrnEj-9UxSs7-zwsSRb-ySbkBT-9UxRSY-zLKhGj-zwrieL-zP4axa-zMWaqy-ySb8uM-zwsV1m-zMWd9u-9UxNxQ-yS2eES-9UuZ6v-9UxMT5-zLKimq-zwxiQH-9Uv49n-zPY2GF"">Joe Giordano, mods made</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Ask any Southeastern backpacker what the best overnight trek in the region is, and the majority will tell you: the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/backpacking-camping/roan-mountain-backpacking"">14-mile traverse</a> of East Tennessee's Roan Mountain Highlands via the Appalachian Trail is a true standout. Not only is it home to one of the most unique shelters on the entire A.T. (the Overmountain Shelter, better known as ""the barn"" because it's, well, a two-story barn), but it also offers up some of the best grassy ""bald"" hiking in America. Think of it almost like the Southeast's version of ridgeline hiking: You're above the trees, surrounded by a sea of billowing grasses in the foreground and a sea of bluish-gray mountains sprawling into every direction in the background, with nothing in the way to obstruct these views. The only downside? Cameras rarely do Roan justice.</p>
<h2>Buckskin Gulch, Utah</h2>
<h6>Buckskin Gulch highlights the beauty of slot canyon hiking in Utah—just make sure to do your homework before venturing out. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/eu5pQ6"">tmac97slc</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>In a region as labyrinthine and loaded with slot canyons as Southern Utah, it's difficult to say that <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/one-of-the-best-hikes-in-america-bucksin-gulch"">Buckskin Gulch</a> is the definitive <em>best</em> slot canyon hike in the region. But it's certainly the longest and the deepest … and, yeah, probably the best, too. For 13 miles, these narrows snake through a mazy tunnel of towering red rock walls, often no more than a wingspan's width apart and so tall that they block out sunlight. Some hikers choose to link up with nearby Paria Canyon for an overnight 20-mile trip, but for day hikers, it's just as rewarding to park at the Wire Pass Trailhead and embark on an out-and-back distance of your choosing. The important things to remember with this hike are largely water-related: First, flash floods are a very real threat, so be sure to check the forecast and plan accordingly. Second, bring more water than you want to carry; the dehydration creeps up quick in the desert.</p>

<h2>Mount Katahdin, Maine</h2>
<h6>A lucky hiker summits Mount Katahdin, the tallest mountain Maine, on a rare day without fog. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/EArBdG"">Foxcroft Academy</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The tallest mountain in Maine and the North Star, northern terminus of the famed Appalachian Trail, Mount Katahdin is truly legendary. It juts upward out of the sprawling expanse of lakes, ponds, and deep woods that define Baxter State Park and towers over the land with a commanding presence. The most iconic way to reach the summit is via the vertiginous spine of the 1-mile Knife's Edge Trail. Along its impossibly narrow and serrated saddle, hikers scramble from Pamola Peak across Chimney Peak to South Peak and finally to the 5,267-foot summit of Katahdin. Once the (likely fog-shrouded) summit photos have been snapped, a roughly 5-mile descent via the Appalachian Trail will take hikers back to the Katahdin Stream Campground trailhead 4,100 feet below.</p>
<h2>Grayson Highlands, Virginia</h2>
<h6>Wild ponies will be your companions on a hike in the Grayson Highlands of Virginia. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/vastateparksstaff/7415096212/in/photolist-cifiLq-jby7UZ-jbzubc-eagfER-cieAyN-jbzvd2-cs5mdY-jbAknj-jbzt4T-jbzy16-jbyf9t-njnHv7-eamVpd-jbCCiG-jbzw64-eagfwM-eamVmd-cieABj-jbCDo7-eamV1q-nASkz4-jbyg7k-nASuXb-eagfPR-dcucSJ-dcucNy-dcuczM-dcud64-dcudeP-nyPzs3-jbybcR-eamVus-jbyecZ-jbAs2w-njnKha-jbyBEV-jby21e-jbzGNg-jbyxZZ-jbymsa-nASssS-jbzFZn-nAzo8R-eamV3Y-jbyzXX-jbyAMH-nASqTj-njnFXh-jbzYjM-dcucKx"">Virginia State Parks</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>In a word, the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/backpacking-camping/grayson-highlands-state-park"">Grayson Highlands of Virginia</a> are breathtaking. In 19 words, they are an almost make-believe land of high mountain meadows, 5,000-foot peaks, thick rhododendron tunnels, and mystical wild ponies. Like most state parks, there's a large variety of activities to pick from (camping, bouldering, fishing, and horseback riding), but arguably the best way to get a comprehensive taste of the park's character in a condensed snapshot is to hike the 8.5-mile out-and-back to the summit of Virginia's highest point: Mount Rogers. The route starts out from the Massie Gap parking area along the Rhododendron Trail. It links with the Appalachian Trail, traveling through grassy pastures sprinkled with boulder outcroppings, and then eventually connects to the Mount Rogers Spur Trail, which twists through a lush, mossy forest to the summit.</p>
<h2>Clouds Rest, California</h2>
<h6>Clouds Rest backs up its dreamy name with views to go along with it. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/awM3RN"">John Strother</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The 14.2-mile round-trip hike to the Clouds Rest summit offers an exceptional taste of what Yosemite National Park is all about. As you're standing atop its 9,926-foot perch, high above Yosemite Valley from a less-witnessed vantage point than the famous Half Dome buttress, with a giant sea of granite and coniferous pines and sequoias below, it's hard to feel anything but utter awe and respect for your surroundings. The trailhead is located in the northeast corner of the park. From here, it's a 7-mile mostly uphill trek whose elevation chart vaguely resembles a healthy year in the stock market—a few spikes up steep ridges here, a few dips into gullies there, but with a pretty consistent uphill hockey stick growth toward the summit. What the chart won't illustrate, however, are all the glorious intangibles along the way—babbling snowmelt streams, sequoias so stout you'd need a group of five to fully hug them, ever-expanding panoramas as you ascend, the tranquillity at the summit, and of course, the icy plunge in Tenaya Lake as a refreshing reward once you return to the trailhead.</p>
<h2>Wheeler Peak, New Mexico</h2>
<h6>Wheeler Peak will challenge your quads, but the panoramic views at the summit make it worth it. <small> <a href=""https://dayfirecompany.com/"">Jake Wheeler</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>It's weird to think that the tallest peak in New Mexico would be overshadowed by anything within the immediate vicinity. But with Southern Colorado's Great Sand Dunes National Park some two hours to the north, and the cultural hotspot of Taos about 45 minutes to the south, that's kind of what happens to Wheeler Peak. Don't let this lack of regional recognition fool you, though: The 8.2-mile round-trip hike to this lofty summit in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains is one of the best in New Mexico and a true lesson in uphill slogging. Averaging about 800 vertical feet per mile, this trail takes hikers through lung-expanding evergreen forests and then up lung-<em>crushing</em> climbs above treeline. What you'll remember other than the impressive summit panorama will be the near endless collection of switchbacks that seem to pinball you back and forth, side to side, and up-and-up through a seemingly infinite sea of scree. Patience—and quad-strength—are both virtues on this hike.</p>
<h2>Appalachian Trail, Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee</h2>
<h6>Whether you're a weekend warrior or a thru-hiker, the Appalachian Trail in the Smokies is an unforgettable hike. <small> <a href=""https://www.kevinstewartphotography.com/"">Kevin Stewart Photography</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>For Appalachian Trail thru-hikers, the 72 miles of the A.T. within the Smokies represent <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/the-insider-s-guide-to-the-appalachian-trail-in-tennessee"">one of the most revered sections</a> of the entire 2,200 mile route. For long-weekend backpackers, this stretch represents one of the most efficient and spectacular ways to get an intimate taste of America's most visited national park. Whichever way you slice it, the Appalachian Trail in the Smokies is a spectacular hiking experience teeming with old-growth forests, incredible biodiversity, challenging climbs, sprawling mountain vistas, and a booming population of fearless and curious black bears. You can't go wrong with any day hike section you choose along this route, but to really maximize the experience, a 4-5 day excursion that covers the entire 72 miles is your best bet. Overnight permits are required, so make sure you plan in advance.</p>
<h2>Half Dome, Yosemite National Park</h2>
<h6>You'll almost certainly be in a long line waiting to officially hike Half Dome. And yes, it's worth it. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/awM5Wu"">John Strother</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>You don't need climbing skill or equipment to scale <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-yosemite-national-park"">Yosemite's</a> iconic <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm"">Half Dome</a>. Using steel cable handrails, hikers can ascend 400 feet up the backside of this granite monolith to reach its summit of 8,840 feet, with panoramic views of the Sierra Mountains in all directions. From the Yosemite Valley floor, Half Dome is a strenuous, 12- to 14-mile round-trip hike. Break up the journey by hiking 4.7 miles to Little Yosemite Valley to camp. Then, hike 3.5 miles to Half Dome and hit the cables early before they're super crowded. Usually, the cables are accessible May through October, and permits are limited, so set a reminder to snag one as soon as they open on March 1. Don't forget to pack plenty of water and bring sturdy gloves.</p>
<h2>Rae Lakes Loop, Kings Canyon National Park</h2>
<h6>The 41.4-mile Rae Lakes Loop is a popular hike in the High Sierras, with stellar lake views. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/fsS1tw"">Kirk Y.</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The 41.4-mile <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/rae-lakes-loop.htm"">Rae Lakes Loop</a> showcases some of the most stunning scenery in the High Sierra. Beginning at 5,041 feet in a forest of pines, cedars, and cottonwoods, the trek requires nearly 7,000 of climbing for hikers to visit emerald meadows and cobalt lakes surrounded by mammoth granite towers. While the hike includes the heart-pounding, 2.1-mile ascent of Glen Pass at 11,998 feet, grades are generally moderate and water is plentiful along the way. To avoid several intense climbs, do this hike clockwise. Due to high demand for permits, <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm"">book as early as possible</a> to March 1, when permits are released, and hike in May to avoid summer crowds.</p>
<h2>Appalachian Trail, Georgia section hike</h2>
<h6>The Georgia section of the AT stretches for nearly 80 miles and is an eye-opener for many would-be hikers about the challenge ahead. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/frM56a"">Alan Cressler</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Northbound AT thru-hikers begin their 2,200-mile journey in Georgia, where the trail climbs high, exceeding 4,000 feet of elevation, to offer epic views from rock outcrops and sublime walks through emerald forests of rhododendron, mountain laurel and moss-covered boulders. Stretching 78.6 miles, the Georgia portion of the AT is not only beautiful but also challenging, with steep, rugged terrain that strains less-seasoned hikers and causes some to abandon their dreams of hiking to Maine. If a thru-hike is a little too ambitious for you, the Georgia AT includes many access points, so several day hikes and short trips are possible. If you begin at Neels Gap you can visit the Mountain Crossings gear store to mingle with thru-hikers and see the only point where the AT passes through a manmade structure. From there, make the steep climb to the summit of Blood Mountain to explore a unique stone trail shelter and enjoy a remarkable view of Appalachian ridges rolling to the horizon.</p>
<h2>Florida National Scenic Trail</h2>
<h6>The Florida National Scenic Trail runs from the state's Panhandle through its southern reaches. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/nfinflorida/24995279523/in/photolist-E5KkMe-ETWC1a-F38GZx-ETWqmP-F38nB4-F39ANx-ETWQji-EtDyUg-EtDybT-F3928r-E5pY5W-EZPvRE-EZQ3KJ-ETWsde-ERDniw-F38ssX-F38wjp-ETWvqr-EtDEZ2-ERDyY5-EA1nbQ-E5KmA8-ERDnG7-EA2nvq-ETXxPH-EA2jXE-EtECYr-ETXqdv-ETXpNH-F38QBX-F38HR2-EA17xG-ERDGRj-F38yAZ-E5r1FA-EtEC1e-EZQwp1-E5KJ3X-F38MLX-F38KT8-ERDBWQ-E5KxfK-sfVEhz-E5LHmp-EZQEDC-yTE9m4-yTE7H4-xnuVcg-wqCG2v-x5Ty6E"">National Forests in Florida</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>One of the most iconic trails in the Southeast, this 1,300-mile route stretches from the state's Panhandle all the way to <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/bicy/index.htm"">Big Cypress National Preserve</a> at the southern end of the state. But you don't have to tackle the whole thing to savor some of its highlights, from serene marshland to spectacular wildlife viewing. Take your pick from a number of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/8-of-the-best-section-hikes-on-the-florida-trail"">excellent section hikes</a>: A few recommended routes include the 11-mile stretch from Clearwater Lake to Alexander Springs, one of the trail's oldest sections, and hikes around Hopkins Prairie, where you're likely to see sandhill cranes and eagles. Campgrounds, both primitive and traditional, are interspersed along the way, so you can easily turn your day hike into an overnighter.</p>
<h2>The Dipsea Trail, Marin County, California</h2>
<h6>The Dipsea Trail in Marin County, north of San Francisco, is home to the oldest trail run in the country. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/J4mag7"">sk</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Don't let this trail's whimsical name fool you: The approximately 7-mile stretch is a doozy, with nearly 688 steps—<em>in the first mile</em>—and long uphill stretches for nearly 2,000 feet in total elevation gain. Even so, doing the Dipsea is a must for any Bay Area hiker or active-minded visitor, with forests that look like they're lifted from a fairytale book, flowy single-track through majestic redwoods, and a finish at the Pacific Ocean. The trail is also home to one of the most infamous trail races in the country (and the oldest): The Dipsea Race, which has drawn hardy runners to battle its roots, ruts, and other ankle-twisting obstacles since 1905. Whether you run it or hike it, you must do it.</p>
<h2>Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, Santa Cruz, California</h2>
<h6>The Skyline-to-the-Sea trail is net downhill, making for an especially rewarding finish at the Pacific Ocean. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/8eVRoL"">Miguel Vieira</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>You can hike its sections separately, but to really experience the essence of this 31-mile trek, one of the best in the San Francisco Bay Area (if not all of California), it's best to make a true adventure of it, with two overnighters on trailside campgrounds. Built over seven years by a local nonprofit, the trail treats hikers to roaring waterfalls and towering coastal redwoods and passes through two excellent state parks, Castle Rock and Big Basin, before culminating at the Pacific Ocean. Another big plus? With a start in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the trail is all net downhill. No surprise, then, that reservations fill up fast, so plan ahead and be patient—it's well worth the effort.</p>
<h2>Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail, New Hampshire</h2>
<h6>This eight-mile round-trip hike to the summit of Mount Washington is a year-round favorite in New England. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/eejiAa"">Annes Travels</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The iconic 6,288-foot Mount Washington in the White Mountains is a challenging and worthy summit, especially in the winter. While many are drawn to its eastern slopes to ski Tuckeman's Ravine, a select few hike the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/west-side-story-hiking-and-skiing-the-ammonoosuc-ravine-trail-on-mount-washington"">Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail</a> on the western side to the mountain's peak. This demanding, approximately eight-mile round-trip route challenges hikers with steep and exposed sections, icy scrambles, and the threat of erratic weather and strong winds. But the stunning views, frozen waterfalls, and exhilaration of standing atop New England's highest peak make the cold toes, burning lungs, and treacherous trek worth it.</p>

<div></div>
<h2>Longs Peak, Colorado</h2>
<h6>Navigating the famous boulder field is just one part of the adventure of this iconic Rockies hike. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/katiedills/2842508440/in/photolist-5kbAJd"">Katie Dills</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Longs Peak's 14,255-foot summit looms over Colorado's northern Front Range, a mountainous beacon summoning the adventurous. A journey to the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/10-thing-know-hiking-longs-peak"">top of Longs</a> is a truly epic undertaking—even for fit hikers. The standard ascent route via the Keyhole is a 15-mile outing with more than 5,500 feet of elevation gain and is usually done in a single 10-to-14-hour push. Most begin in the darkness around 2 am, catching the sunrise above treeline about five miles in at the famous boulder field. Crossing through the Keyhole dramatically changes the character of the hike from a steady, class-2 cruise to a wild, exposed, class-3 scramble along well-marked ledges. A tough push up a loose gully called ""The Trough"" grinds up to 14,000 feet, where there is still work to do. A steep scramble through the ""Home Stretch"" exits atop the surprisingly flat, broad summit block. After all that work, there's still the challenge of getting down safely. Big, bold, and tough, Longs is one of the most amazing adventures in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h2>Mount Frissell, Connecticut/Massachusetts</h2>
<h6>Mount Frissell is one of the most stunning hikes in New York's Taconic Mountains. <small> Morrowlong </small>
</h6>
<p>At 2,454 feet, <a href=""https://www.mountainouswords.com/mountain-air/mount-frissell-highest-point-in-connecticut/"">Mount Frissell</a> stands in the heart of southern New England and New York's rolling Taconic Mountains. When the full force of the changing seasons paints the trees in hues of red, yellow, and orange, this hike makes a strong case as the most beautiful in the region. A modest, 1-mile trail start from Mount Riga Road in Massachusetts and gently climbs through scrub oak to the summit of 2,289-foot Round Mountain before continuing to the top of Mount Frissell. Unlike most hikes, however, you'll get the best views beyond the summit. Passing into Connecticut, hikers come across the highest point in Connecticut at 2,380 feet on the south slopes of Mount Frissell—keep going! At 0.5 miles past the highpoint pin is the Connecticut-New York-Massachusetts tri-point marker, and roughly another mile past that are the panoramic views of rolling farmland and distant Appalachian mountains from 2,311-foot Brace Mountain. Return the way you came for excellent views of neighboring mountain domes to the north.</p>
<h2>Peak One, Colorado</h2>
<h6>The challenging hike to the summit of Colorado's Peak One includes spectacular views. <small> <a href=""https://www.townoffrisco.com"">Todd Powell/ Frisco</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>At 12,933 feet, Peak One is more than 1,400 feet lower than Colorado's highest peak, but what it lacks in elevation it makes up for in unmatched views. Access is easy, with the trailhead located right off highway I-70. Hikers climb past the ruins of an old mining town before breaking treeline. A class-2+ ridgewalk reveals the depth and beauty of Colorado's high country. Dillon Reservoir sits at the foot of the peak to the east, where the mighty Front Range 14ers stand in the distance. The northern views are dominated by the mysterious and challenging Gore Range, while far-off Sawatch Range mountains decorate the western horizon. A fun, brief scramble ascends the summit. Turn around at that point for an 8-mile out-and-back with more than 3,000 feet of elevation gain—or keep traversing along the Tenmile Range to Tenmile Mountain and beyond. Hiking from Peak One to Peak Ten is one of Colorado's big point-to-point testpiece adventures.</p>
<h2>Humphreys Peak, Arizona</h2>
<h6>Arizona's highest point, Humphreys Peak boasts fascinating history along with its views. <small> <a href=""https://flic.kr/p/6XvYnF"">Coconino National Forest</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The highest point in Arizona, 12,633-foot Humphreys Peak is an ambitious peak to bag, with an impressive history to ponder as you conquer it. Geologists speculate this strato-volcano once stood much higher until it experienced a Mount St. Helens-style eruption that resulted in its trademark bowl and diminished height. The Arizona Snowbowl ski area is set on the flanks of the peaks San Francisco Peaks, of which Humphreys is the tallest. A hike to the top travels through pine forests and out of treeline along a well-maintained trail through chunky volcanic rock. Admire the power that shook the land as you take the final steps to the airy summit, where views span out into the lowlands that transform into far-off deserts and canyons. It's about nine miles round-trip, with 3,000 feet of elevation from the standard route on the Humphreys Peak Trail.</p>
<h2>Greenstone Ridge Trail, Isle Royale National Park</h2>
<h6>Greenstone Ridge Trail, Isle Royale National Park. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/wlscience/2741313124/in/photolist-5baDHi-5b7aGf-5baD7v-5baEU4-5baEzi-5baF5D-5beW9J-5beWTo-5beXHC-5beVxC-5baCSM-5b3dVv-5b2QYe-5b7bkS-5baCrg-5pTygY-5pPgmX"">Ben W</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Located on an island in Lake Superior that's 45 miles long and just nine miles wide, this <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-isle-royale-national-park"">national park</a> is so remote you'll have to take a ferry or seaplane to access it. But once you do, you'll have your pick of 165 miles of hiking trails that cover spectacular terrain, including the ruins of an old copper mine and a lighthouse that dates back to the late 1800s. Many hikers flock to the Greenstone Ridge Trail, which runs along the spine of the island, but the Minong Trail is a 52-mile trek that's slightly harder, but with far fewer people and just as stunning views, wildflowers, and up-and-close wildlife viewing. Choose from several out-and-back routes, or make it a point-to-point overnight trip (there are 36 first-come, first-serve campgrounds) and you just might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights.</p>

<div>
<p>Sometimes we need to go deeper into the woods—farther off the proverbial beaten path. The only way to accommodate this is to plan for an overnight backpacking adventure. Here, we have highlighted some of the best overnight backpacking trails in America's national parks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. LYELL CANYON-VOGELSANG LOOP, YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, CALIFORNIA</strong></p>
<p><em>19.6 miles, 2,270 feet of elevation gain, moderately difficult</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The Lyell Canyon-Vogelsang Loop Trail takes two to three days. The trail is part of the Pacific Crest Trail, so you’re likely to see thru hikers on much longer hikes than this.</p>
<p>This particular trek through Yosemite’s Cathedral Range takes you through stunning landscape while it’s accessible, from May until October. To do it as a backpacking trip, begin at the Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Permit Station and head toward the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River. After crossing the river, turn east (you'll run into the returning trail here, coming down from Vogelsang). Continue along the John Muir/Pacific Crest Trail toward Lyell Canyon and Donohue Pass through fields of wildflowers within the flat canyon. When you reach the junction at Ireland Creek, you’ll leave the John Muir Trail and turn toward Vogelsang and Ireland Lake.</p>
<p>Here the trail becomes a lung buster as you climb through the forest to the top of the ridge between Lyell Canyon and Rafferty Creek, gaining an expansive view of the Cathedral Range. You can find spots for camping here, but only a few have access to water. Other favorite campsites are under Fletcher Peak near Vogelsang, near an unnamed lake, and near Evelyn Lake.</p>
<p>From the top of the ridge, a slow hike downward past several lakes leads to Vogelsang High Sierra Camp. From here the trail drops to Tuolumne Pass, then descends into the valley of Rafferty Creek before one last drop to the Tuolumne River and, incidentally, the trail you started on.</p>
<p><strong>2. COSBY KNOB, GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS, TENNESSEE AND NORTH CAROLINA</strong></p>
<p><em>7.4 miles, 2,000 feet of climbing, difficult</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>If you’re just getting into overnight backpacking trips, this short one is a good place to start. Use it to test a new pack and other gear. This in-and-out hike begins and ends at Cosby Campground in Tennessee. Traffic along this stretch is light in spite of the Great Smoky Mountains getting more annual visitors than any other U.S. National Park.</p>
<p>Both the Appalachian Trail and Low Gap Trail II lead to Cosby Knob. Start from the Cosby Campground and climb Low Gap Trail for almost three miles. Then, either follow Cosby Creek for the a half mile or hike through the campground to the Low Cap Trail. That trail is marked difficult due to a steep, short climb of nearly 2,000 feet with switchbacks over several ravines. At the ridge, take a right where Low Gap Trail joins the Appalachian Trail, and follow the Appalachian for 0.9 miles (another 500-foot ascent) to the Cosby Knob Shelter, which is just across the state line in North Carolina. The shelter sleeps 12, has a fire ring nearby, a freshwater spring, and an open porch with seating.</p>
<p><strong>3. HOH RIVER TRAIL TO GLACIER MEADOWS, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON</strong></p>
<p><em>17.4 miles, 3,700 feet of elevation gain, easy to moderate</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The Hoh River Trail will lead you through temperate rainforest, subalpine meadow, meadow basin, montane forest, across one river and a few other small streams. The trail is well-maintained and generally flat for the first 13 miles before the climb to Glacier Meadows.</p>
<p>Possible campgrounds along the way include gravel bars on the Hoh River or pre-existing sites, such as Tom Creek, Five Mile Island, Happy Four, Olympus Guard Station, Lewis Meadow, Elk Lake, and of course, Glacier Meadows. (No camping is allowed above Martin Creek.)</p>
<p>This trail is best hiked from June through September. From the end of the trail, don’t fail to take in the views of Mt. Olympus and Blue Glacier.</p>
<p><strong>4. CORRAL CREEK TRAIL TO MIRROR LAKE, ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, COLORADO</strong></p>
<p><em>12.2 miles, 945 feet of ascent, moderate in difficulty</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>This out-and-back trail begins and ends at the Corral Creek Trailhead just outside Rocky Mountain National Park, along a flat dirt road that turns into trail along Corral Creek. About 1.3 miles in, enter RMNP and then turn south into a gorge carved by the Cache LaPoudre River, which it parallels for the half mile to the Mummy Pass Trail Split, and then climbs steadily for .75 miles before offering a brief .5-mile break. The main climb leads you up through a forested ridge for the 4.3 miles to the Mirror Lake Trail Split.</p>
<p>Turn left (north) to Mirror Lake, a little gem surrounded by unnamed peaks. Nearby, backcountry trails lead to campsites. Campers have spotted various wildlife, including moose in the meadows along the way. Gorgeous aspen trees, ponds and lakes, open rocky areas, abundant wildflowers, stunning views—it’s the perfect backpacker’s trip. If you’re spending a couple of days here, or feel like trekking more once you set up camp, hike to Sky Pond about a quarter mile past Mirror Lake.</p>
<p><strong>5. GUNSIGHT PASS TRAIL, GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, MONTANA</strong></p>
<p><em>19.7 miles, 3,287 feet in elevation gain, moderate to difficult</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>This trek requires logistics. Park at the Lake McDonald Lodge and catch the first shuttle to Logan Pass for another shuttle down toward St. Mary Lake. Get out at the Jackson Glacier Turnout, where the trek actually begins, off of Going to the Sun Road.</p>
<p>The trail runs between Saint Mary Lake and Lake McDonald and passes glacial lakes and through surreal, diverse terrain. Look for Gunsight Lake along the trail, with its turquoise color caused by ""glacial flour"" suspended in water.</p>
<p>This trail is great for two- to three-day adventures. Backcountry campsites are located at Gunsight Lake, Lake Ellen Wilson, and near the Sperry Chalet.</p>

"589639254199","a-slice-of-heaven-for-central-florida-runners","MERGE","The 10 Mile Clay Loop: A Slice of Heaven for Central Florida Runners","Superfeet","<p>Run favorite trails and routes often enough and they often begin to blend together. We know exactly where to turn, which soft spots to avoid, where every hill starts, and when we get to cut our legs loose and get after it. But what is it that makes certain trails and running routes so special?</p>
<p>Like almost any outdoor sport or activity, the community is often what makes a certain trail or experience memorable. The reason certain areas are so well maintained and vibrant is a direct result of the surrounding community.</p>
<h6>Runners out for an early morning run together on the 10 Mile Clay Loop <small> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/10-Mile-Clay-Loop-708378072513810/?fref=nf"">Curtis Henderson</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>One of the most active outdoor communities near Orlando is in a small suburb called Clermont. Their trail of choice is the 10 Mile Clay Loop. At first glance it may seem a little lackluster. It’s a clay road around cow pastures and old orange groves. But the combination of soft dirt, rolling hills, and the away-from-everything feel of the locale makes for running nirvana. As this is a road, so you may see some vehicular traffic, yet not much. Plus it's plenty wide for passing, and even running three, four, or five across.</p>
<p>The best running happens early in the morning before the sun comes up. It’s cool and humid, often with a layer of fog blanketing still green pastures. Once the sun rises, you'll see all the other runners out for their early morning sweat session on the 10-mile loop, everyone from high school teams to running clubs, to professionals to those out on their daily run. Some are running a lap, or two, and others are getting in some hill work. Think Florida’s flat? Talk to some of the professional runners that come here to run on the soft, yet leg-burning hills.</p>
<p>On occasion, professional athletes, like triathlete Michellie Jones and runners Jenny Barringer and Nick Symmonds, can be spotted amongst the regulars, high school athletes, and weekend warriors.</p>
<hr>
<p><br>The Loop is no ordinary dirt road; it's soft, smooth, and forgiving.</p>
<p>“Such a nice run. I love it out here,"" said 800m World Champion David Rudisha after a visit. ""This was like Kenya, but with no rocks. Soft, yet quick.”</p>
<p>Some professional runners, like <a href=""http://www.runnersworld.com/rt-web-exclusive/clermonts-10-mile-clay-loop-florida"">Sarah Haskins</a> who competed in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing China, consider the 10 Mile Clay Loop their home training trail.</p>
<p>Aside from being a great training ground for professionals and locals alike, the community also puts on some fun, friendly, runs throughout the year. The most notable is the Death March in June. The race starts around 1:00pm and runners must have at least 12-ounces of water when leaving checkpoints on the 5K and 10-mile routes due to the brutally hot and shadeless conditions.</p>
<p>For those who prefer racing in cooler temperatures, the <a href=""https://runsignup.com/Race/FL/Clermont/ClermontClay15K"">Clermont Clay 15K</a>, a one lap run of the loop, happens Sunday, November 22. Follow the directions in your phone or on your GPS to <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Downtown+Orlando,+South+Orange+Avenue,+Orlando,+FL/8928+N+Bradshaw+Rd,+Winter+Garden,+FL+34787/@28.5132376,-81.6188191,30761m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88e77af9b07c859b:0xc74468bc33f5fc76!2m2!1d-81.3798099!2d28.5375263!1m5!1m1!1s0x88e788f2a873cd59:0x7c9b9ad9d87f87a7!2m2!1d-81.7140565!2d28.4758843?hl=en"">8928 North Bradshaw Road, Winter Garden, FL 34711</a>. Be on the lookout for event volunteers that'll help direct you where to park.</p>
<p>On race days, portable facilities are usually on site for use. Any other day though, go before you get to the trailhead or be prepared to become one with nature, discretely of course.</p>
<p>The next time you’re in Central Florida and are looking for a good run or some hill work that’s easy on the knees, give this loop a run. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and bug spray.

<h3>Ball Roll on Arch</h3>

<div>
<p>The first one we're going to do is a little bit of mobility work for our arches. You are going to need some kind of a ball for this exercise. I have a lacrosse ball here, but a tennis ball or anything similar works.<br><br>Take the lacrosse ball and put it underneath your foot. I'm going to start at the top part of my foot here. As you can see, I'm on the ground; I am not going to put too much weight on my foot. I don't need my whole body weight pushing down. I'm going to slowly start to move back and forth from underneath the first knuckle, below my big toe, all the way down to my heel on the outside of my arch, working back and forth. And I'm going to slowly start to move inwards out towards my pinkies, just going up and down and back and forth.</p>
<p>Now for me, I have, as you can see, decently high arches. I tend to get a little bit of pain in my arch and I really like to focus attention on some of those tender spots. Ooh, right there. When I'm feel a tender spot while rolling, I'm going to pause, point my toe up, flex and extend. Once again, not putting too much pressure on my feet here, especially if this is your first time doing this. You want to be nice and easy and controlled. And then you're going to switch to other side. <br><br>Spend two-ish minutes on this exercise.</p>
</div>
<h3>Flex and Extend with Band</h3>
<figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Foot_Stretches_and_Exercises_For_Your_Running_Routine-low_1_0637d9e2-7d5f-4582-a697-38d2e0b8bd90_480x480.gif?v=1734447774""></figure>
<div>
<p>The next move we're going to do is going to be a little bit of mobility and strength built combined. For this you are going to need a band. If you don't have a band that is okay — you can use a towel, or even a long sleeve shirt with the arms tied together. <br><br>I'm going to sit on the floor with my legs straight out in front of me. Put a little bit of bend in the knees. I'm going to take my band and I'm going to put it right around the middle part of my foot up on the top portion of the arch. I don't want to put it too much on my toes because once I point my toes towards me, my band might slip and I might get a slap in the face. I also don't want it too low because then it's not going to do anything. So, right in the middle of the foot. <br><br>The nice thing about this exercise is that you can make it harder or easier by adjusting the band to make it tighter (harder) or releasing it so there is more give (easier). I am going to do about 10 to 15 reps for this exercise on each side. I'm going to point my toes all the way back, and then push them out as far as I can, flexing and extending the foot. Be sure to do this exercise with slow and controlled movement. Don't let your foot spring back — move slowly as you extend and flex.</p>
</div>

<h3>Toe-ga</h3>
<figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Foot_Stretches_and_Exercises_For_Your_Running_Routine-low_2_2e6ff8e0-c495-4547-ac46-4d513069c642_480x480.gif?v=1734447773""></figure>
<div>
<p>I'm sure you've heard of yoga, but what about toe-ga? That's yoga, for your toes.</p>
<p>I'm going to stand up for this one. The first thing we're going to do is focus on pushing the big toe down into the ground and just slowly lifting and holding up my four other toes.</p>
<p>The first couple times I started to do this my feet really started to cramp because I was just scrunching my feet up. If that happens, shake out your feet and give them a couple of squeezes there. <br><br>After you've done that, you are going to do the opposite. Focus on pushing your other four toes down and just lifting up the big toe. Lifting up the big toe. You'll probably notice a big difference on each foot as well too. And that's okay. That's why we're here. That's why we're doing this, to get to know our feet a little bit better.</p>
<p>Once again, try to aim for 10 to 15 reps with both of these exercises. In between you can go into a little bit of a down dog position. I like to kind of just sit on my toes and stretch them out here. Kind of sit my weight back into my heels. Take a couple deep breaths. Let those feet stretch out in between. I like to do the other two exercises first and save this one for last, because hopefully by that time, my feet are going to be nice and warmed up.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>One of the great things about taking the time to work on foot strength and mobility is it doesn't take a lot of effort. <br><br>We can do these foot stretch and mobility exercises multiple times a week and it's really not going to fatigue us. Try to add these exercises in about three to four times a week. If you're newer to these exercises or you are experiencing a little bit of pain, start on the easier side and build into it. We don't want to just take it on all or nothing. Because it is easy, it sometimes we take it too far. So once again, just like anything else, we want to make sure that you're building up into it. <br><br>Happy feet = happy running!</p>

<p>Forget what you’ve heard about ""flyover states""—when the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/noco/index.htm"">North Country National Scenic Trail</a> is completed, you’ll skip the plane and walk there. Following a 4,600-mile hiking path from New York to North Dakota, the NCT showcases the best of the best from the eastern U.S. to the upper Midwest. Feel the gales of Lake Superior in Michigan, explore the rocky landscape of southern Ohio, and see the glacial countryside in Wisconsin and Minnesota. No matter where you go on the trail, you’ll get a taste of exactly what makes the northern states special.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h4>The Old North Country</h4>
<p><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--Ef2fKVuu--/t_rr_large_natural/klpsfgbmkod1zezbl3qf.jpg""></p>
<p><sup><sub> <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_Country_National_Scenic_Trail_Sign_Copper_Falls_State_Park_August_2012.jpg"">Royalbroil</a></sub></sup></p>
<p>The North Country Trail’s path is a direct result of the people who hike it, emerging from initial planning meetings in the 1970s. It could have been much different though—past-proposed paths ran a huge loop through the Upper Peninsula, followed along Lake Michigan, ran with the Sheyenne River in North Dakota, and linked to the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>The Appalachian Trail has a lot to do with the founding of the North Country Trail, even though the two never meet. When the National Trails System Act of 1968 solidified the AT’s route as a National Scenic Trail, 14 other routes were proposed—including the North Country Trail. Without the Appalachian Trail’s early recognition, the NCT might not exist today. Congress authorized the North Country National Scenic Trail on March 5, 1980.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h4>North Country Now</h4>
<p><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--i_G7sCCB--/t_rr_large_natural/d94xeltfl9grtbbcqfjs.jpg""></p>
<p><sup><sub> <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NorthCountryTrailWI.JPG"">MDuchek</a></sub></sup></p>
<p>Today, the North Country Trail stretches across seven states, covering broad swaths of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota. It will run 4,600 miles when it is completed, through the northern heartland of America, deep into thick woods, along stunning lakes, and atop breathtaking bluffs. As of now, it’s still under construction. The majority is completed (there are currently more trail miles than the Appalachian Trail) but much of it is joined with temporary connectors until volunteers build permanent trails. The NCT is on track to be the longest continuous hiking trail in the United States, bringing travelers a taste of all the cultural, historic, scenic, and natural areas the northern U.S. has to offer. For 40 percent of the U.S. population, the trail is within a day’s drive. It passes through 12 National Forests and is open year-round.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h4>Take a Hike</h4>
<p>Thru-hiking the North Country Trail is an incredibly rare feat—several have tried and called it off halfway, and only a few have completed the entire thing. It’s a difficult proposition and requires careful planning. An entire end-to-end hike, at a rate of 20 miles a day, will take six months or more. You’ll start or end in snowy conditions, in a part of the country that has severe winters and large snowfall. Plus, to truly do a thru-hike you have to walk across the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan, which is only open to foot traffic for a few hours on Labor Day. The official North Country Trail Association policy on end-to-end hikes no longer requires that bridge crossing, but purists will want to plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Short-term hikers can be much looser in their agenda. Spring and fall are the best times to head out. In the heart of summer, hikers will face sweltering heat, humidity, and persistent bugs. In winter expect bone-chilling wind and high snowfall. Then again, the trail can be particularly peaceful in winter, when the path is glowing white from snow and almost no one is out but the wildlife.</p>
<p>Plan your route to hit some of the major landmarks. The NCT features more than a dozen waterfalls, thousands of lakes and hundreds of rivers, old-growth forests, tallgrass prairies, several different mountain ranges, and even a few cities. Based on the time of year, you’ll have the chance to swim, snowshoe, cross-country ski, run, bike, and ride horses (though this last option is only legal in North Dakota). Also keep in mind that some parts of the trail are state parks and don’t allow dogs.</p>
<p><strong>For a good day hike</strong>, try the Great U.P Variety trail through the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. You’ll hike up rocky outcroppings for wide-open views of Lake Superior, see more than 100 native plant species, and walk through stately pine trees and hardwood forests. Weekend hikers, try the 19.5-mile trip along the Brule River in Wisconsin—it’s a segment of the Historic Portage Trail, a route used for thousands of years by Native Americans, explorers, fur traders, and settlers.</p>
<p>Sections of the trail can sometimes close due to inclement weather, so make sure to do your research before you head out. Also check out when the local hunting season is. If you’re going at the same time, put an orange vest in your pack. Adventures both small and great await on this most epic of American hiking trails.</p>

<p>Colorado’s high country is full of renowned hikes to 14,000-foot peaks, deep into the backcountry or up and over remote passes. But scattered throughout the state are hundreds of marvelous and pristine high-mountain lakes well worth a visit. Soak your feet, dunk your head, and check out these Colorado alpine lake hikes that should be on your radar.</p>
<p><strong>1. HEART LAKE</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--SnJgqGox--/t_rr_large_natural/tnpl9e6nhgteowggr2fs.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Roger's Peak overlooks Heart Lake. Graham Silver</sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>The 4.3-mile hike to <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/cody-and-east-yellowstone-wy/backpacking-camping/heart-lake"">Heart Lake</a> begins at the east portal of the Moffat Tunnel. There is a large parking area next to the historic train tunnel, about 10 miles east of the town of Rollinsville. The trail takes you past the tunnel, crossing the South Boulder Creek a few times as it trickles down from the Continental Divide. Follow signs for South Boulder Creek Trail past the turn offs for Arapaho Lakes, Forest Lakes and Crater Lakes.  It becomes moderately steep and you will gain about 1,900 feet in elevation by the time you reach Roger’s Lake. This is a great place to take a break and enjoy the views of Roger’s Peak before making the final push. You will climb out of the trees and up a steep 0.2-mile face that leads you to a ridge just above Heart Lake. From here, you have views of two incredible lakes and the entire South Boulder Creek drainage.</p>
<p><strong>2. STEUART, REYNOLDS AND OHMAN LAKES</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--ujD9S6Mx--/t_rr_large_natural/fzhhovgk6jxpp2jauuq2.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Trek into the James Peak Wilderness to see Reynold's and Stuert lakes. Graham Silver</sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>These picturesque lakes sit above the historic town sites of St. Mary’s and Alice in the James Peak Wilderness. The area is an easy hour drive <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/4-must-visit-rocky-mountain-lakes-near-denver"">from Denver</a> and sees heavy traffic throughout the year due to the nearby St. Mary’s Glacier.</p>
<p>Skip the glacier and head to the trail, starting at the intersection of Alice Road and Steuart Road. The first 2.4 miles scale past timberline to Loch Lomond, the first and largest of the lakes. Continue along the west end of lake toward the waterfall and climb an additional 800 feet to a series of three other alpine lakes. This is the steep and strenuous part of the hike where you will have a few water crossings, minor scrambling and terrific views of Loch Lomond below. The hike flattens out as it winds around Reynolds Lake on its way to Steuart and Ohman Lakes. The total distance to Ohman Lake is 3.5 miles over 1,200 feet of elevation.</p>
<p><strong>3. CATHEDRAL LAKE</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--yiJf-y1D--/t_rr_large_natural/eid6ui5gynij6frjcsxu.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>The phenomenal view from Cathedral Lake is as good as it gets in Colorado. <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/imme/1464079861/in/photolist-q6QJFq-BmGMEd-hPvnVG-fTNvcQ-gd93EY-aDoxdA-gcmAdg-pVwBGZ-fr892a-hNWx7J-3bSWVf-3enMWe-f7sDkc"">im me</a></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p><a href=""https://rootsrated.com/aspen-co/hiking/cathedral-lake-hiking"">The hike to Cathedral Lake</a> may be one of the best ways to take in all of Colorado’s mountain beauty. Located in the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/aspen-co/hiking/maroon-bells-and-crater-lake-hiking"">Maroon Bells</a>-Snowmass Wilderness area, Cathedral Lake offers the unforgettable turquoise blue water. The surrounding mountains are some of the state’s most incredible, rugged peaks.</p>
<p>The trailhead is located 13 miles south of Aspen, along Castle Creek Road. The 2.8-mile trail rises through aspen groves along a creek of dense willows and well decorated wildflower meadows. Though relatively short, the hike traverses steep terrain and gains a grueling 1,980 feet. Cathedral Lake sits well above treeline surrounded by three profound 13ers.</p>
<p><strong>4. WHEELER LAKES</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--sCwq8mpe--/t_rr_large_natural/ws2m9rcsjafayxcwf6hs.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Pass the ponds near Wheeler Lakes en route to views of Copper Mountain. Graham Silver</sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>The hike to Wheeler Lakes is perfect for a quick afternoon getaway or a colorful autumn trek. The trailhead is so obvious that you could easily miss it, beginning, as it does, next to the off-ramp from I-70 to Copper Mountain.</p>
<p>The first mile zig-zags through aspens and pines with views of Copper Mountain to the South. The first half of the hike will get your heart rate going as you cover most of the 1,400 feet of elevation gain. It flattens out around 11,000 feet as the trail winds through meadows and past nice overlooks with views of the Holy Cross Wilderness to the west and Tenmile Range to the east. Wheeler Lakes are 3.1 miles from the trailhead and sit within thick pine forest. A bonus option would be to carry on past Wheeler and make your way back down Officer’s Gulch. Just plan ahead and leave a car at the Officer’s Gulch trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>5. ISLAND LAKE</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--yEEm-0bc--/t_rr_large_natural/nxd4nntgncshdlvztxoi.jpg"">

</figure>
<p>The San Juan Mountains in southern Colorado are home to a few notable glacial lakes, but possible the most unique is Island Lake. This is a challenging hike with almost 3,000 feet of elevation gain that takes you well into the Upper Ice Lake basin. The lake is an aquamarine blue with a rock mound jutting out of the center, creating the island for which it was named.</p>
<p>The trailhead is next to the South Mineral Campground located along Forest Road 585, about 19 miles west of the town of Silverton. The hike is a 4-mile incline and maintains a steep and exhausting grade.</p>
<p>Along the route, you will see old mining equipment, waterfalls, abundant wildflowers, and views of many 13ers, including Ulysses S. Grant Peak hanging above Island Lake. The lake’s elevation is 12,400 feet and you can add a bonus lake to your descent by traversing about a half mile south to Ice Lake (12,280). Ice Lake’s water is a lighter, brilliant blue and feeds a waterfall that can be seen on hike back down the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/durango-co/trail-running/ice-lake-basin-trail-running"">Ice Lake Basin</a>. The entire loop is just over eight miles.  </p>
<p>At the mid-point or all along the way of all of these hikes are stunning views and cool, refreshing water. The only disappointment will come when you need to leave these sparkling gems for home.</p>

<p>Since our humble beginnings as the Sports Medicine Division of the Northwest Podiatric Laboratory more than 40 years ago, Superfeet has used scientific knowhow and biometric data to push the boundaries of innovation in all areas of foot comfort. The <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/superfeet-shape"">proprietary Superfeet shape</a> that delivers unrivaled support, enhanced performance and pain relief was created to better accommodate the contours of the human foot and allow your feet to move the way they are supposed to, no matter the shoes you wear or the unforgiving surfaces you walk on.  </p>
<p>A lot has changed since 1977, but our commitment to helping millions of people feel good on their feet using the latest scientific advancements and cutting-edge technology has never wavered. If anything, it has only gotten stronger!</p>

<h2>WHAT ARE ME3D PERSONALIZED INSOLES?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/me3d"">ME3D personalized insoles</a> are the newest innovation at Superfeet. These completely personalized, 3D-printed insoles are constructed to match the exact geometry of each individual foot. As we like to say around here, no two feet are alike – not even your own! It’s like wearing a tailor-made outfit that fits just right. Foot comfort has never been more couture.</p>
<p>Superfeet offers comprehensive measuring and assessment tools at running and sporting goods stores across the country. Using both a 360-degree three-dimensional scan and pressure pad data that records your biomechanics while you walk, we can form a complete picture of your unique feet and design an insole with incredible accuracy and precision to deliver the most comfortable experience you’ve ever had slipping into a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>The measurements and gait-cycle data from your scans are then sent off to the printer (the 3D printer, that is) and molded to match the contours of your feet and the way you move. You can even customize your new pair of ME3Ds with your name on the back. After all, these aren’t just any old shoe inserts, these are personalized premium insoles for your feet only.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2>HOW ARE ME3D DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CUSTOM INSOLES?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>For serious foot ailments, podiatrists can prescribe custom orthotics specifically made to address certain conditions. But these solutions are only meant for extreme cases and are still often a last resort. Prescription orthotics can cost hundreds of dollars, even after insurance.</p>
<p>Whether you are experiencing discomfort, want to boost performance while running, or just enjoy feeling your best even after a long day on your feet, premium insoles, especially a pair personalized to you, are an ideal option. But while the benefits of bespoke insoles are clear, deciding which ones are right for you is anything but. Let’s take a look at the different types of custom insoles and why ME3D offer a few distinct advantages.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that personalized insoles need to be made using specific measurements from a person’s feet, but how those measurements are obtained and just how much biomechanical information they convey can affect the resulting insoles.</p>
<p>Most custom shoe inserts, even some prescription orthotics, are taken from impressions of your feet left in foam. The footprints left behind show the size of your foot and the shape of your arch, but only while you are standing still. The dynamic pressure pad that gathers data for ME3D, on the other hand, creates virtual footprints based on the pressure you exert while walking.</p>
<p>Shown via a heat map with red illustrating areas of high pressure and blue indicating low pressure areas, these virtual footprints create a more complete picture of the way you move. That is a crucial difference since you’ll be doing more than just standing still in your insoles. Using the biomechanics of your gait allows ME3D to not only be personalized to the shape of your foot but also to the way your foot moves as you walk, thanks to five variable support zones along the heel and arch that can be tuned to the motion of your particular feet.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/me3d"">Find out more</a> about all ME3D insoles have to offer, including the two available styles: the original ME3D for a personalized slim fit and ME3D Max, personalized plush support with dual-layer cushioning. </p>

<p>Chattanooga has an amazing selection of backpacking options close by including some destinations in nearby North Georgia. Josh Legg, hiking and backpacking enthusiast at Rock Creek Outfitters suggested the following locations which all share characteristics that make them inherently enjoyable (i.e. scenic, wild, dense forest, water and stone features, beautiful views). You’ll find points of interest included in the list for each place in lieu of a lengthy description. Be sure to pack the gear you’ll need and check the hiking and backpacking regulations for a specific area before traveling to it.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>No one likes achy, sore, or strained feet, but the importance of foot health goes far beyond just pain-free steps. Keeping your feet healthy and comfortable is a pivotal part of your overall wellness and can greatly improve your quality of life. Foot pain affects your entire lower body and even your back – not just your feet. It can also prevent you from staying active, which could lead to other health problems.</p>
<p>""Having healthy, pain-free feet is essential to living an active lifestyle,"" says Matt Gooch, Certified Pedorthist and Vice President of Product and Innovation at Superfeet. ""Foot pain is one of the single largest deterrents to the average adult spending more time on their feet.""</p>
<p>Luckily, simple changes can often have huge benefits for your feet. Let’s go over some common foot conditions, how footwear can impact how your feet feel, and why keeping your feet healthy is so important.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The Benefits of Good Foot Health</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever experienced foot pain, you know the toll it can take on your entire life. Serious cases can impact where you go and what you do. Even mild discomfort can have lasting effects, especially if you work on your feet all day. In other words, it’s not something you can tiptoe around – you have to put your foot down!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>There are obvious<span> benefits to maintaining good foot health like less pain, improved foot strength and flexibility, and better mobility and independence. But there are less obvious rewards, as well, like better posture and body alignment, reduced joint pain and inflammation, and greater overall well-b</span>eing and mental health. When you’re happy on your feet, everything from complex workouts to simply walking the dog become more enjoyable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Common Foot Problems and Their Causes</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Feet are complex. With over <a title=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21597-foot-ligaments"" href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21597-foot-ligaments"">100 ligaments</a>, muscles and tendons, 33 joints and 28 bones (including the two sesamoid bones under the 1st metatarsal bone) per foot, it’s important to keep the whole system working well together to prevent things from going wrong. But injuries do happen, and some conditions are more common than others. Here are some of the most common causes of foot pain.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Plantar fasciitis is inflammation caused by excessive stretching of the tissue on the bottom of your foot. This broad connective structure is called the plantar fascia and acts like a big rubber band connecting your heel bone to your toes. It is the first line of support as your foot hits the ground.</p>
<p>Hours of work or running on hard surfaces, especially in flat shoes, can put too much strain on the plantar fascia and cause immense pain at the back of the foot where the fascia tissue meets the heel bone.</p>
<p>Feet that are more flexible could be prone to additional stress placed on the plantar fascia during walking, running, and prolonged standing. This is the most common cause of “heel pain,” though the heel is not the only area in which the plantar fascia can become inflamed. For more information on plantar fasciitis, check out <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/plantar-fasciitis-explained"">Plantar Fasciitis Explained</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Foot Stress Fractures</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Bone fractures seem scary and, while never a good thing, aren’t always as dire as they sound. <a title=""https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/stress-fractures-of-the-foot-and-ankle/"" href=""https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/stress-fractures-of-the-foot-and-ankle/"">Stress fractures</a> usually refer to microscopic fissures in the bones of your foot that develop over a long period of time from repetitive stress. They rarely require surgery but can cause intense pain and should be treated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Stress fractures are primarily caused by prolonged activity that exerts forces on the foot in repetitive ways. They can also occur when new actions or exercises are introduced to a routine. Proper support and stability under the foot, especially during high impact activities, helps protect your feet and prevent stress fractures.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Flat Feet or Fallen Arches</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>For many people, the tendons in the foot connect in a way that lifts the middle of the sole. You are said to have flat feet if you have a minimal arch or no arch at all — the entire bottom surface of your foot is in complete or near complete contact with the ground while standing. When you walk barefoot in the sand, your tracks show a complete outline of your feet. Someone with high arches would leave marks only with their heel and forefoot.</p>
<p>The shape of your feet is determined, for the most part, by your genes. Most people have flat feet as small children as the internal structure of the foot has not fully developed. As people age, many people form a visible contour in the middle of their feet. Others do not. Either situation is considered normal. Some use the term “fallen arches” to describe when your feet become flatter and less contoured over time either because of an injury or simply due to aging.</p>
<p>Having flat feet doesn’t automatically mean you’ll experience pain, but if you do, hard, flat surfaces, and unsupportive footwear can exacerbate the problem.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The Importance of Choosing the Right Footwear</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Though there are many differen<span>t foot problems and injuries that range in symptoms from mild discomfort to agonizing pain, many have the same simple solution: proper support and cushioning under the foot. That’s why choosing the right footwear for better foot health is key.</span></p>
<p>Most running and athletic shoes come with some support built in. But the removable liners that come with your shoes may not meet your specific needs or provide enough structure to support your arches. ""People are often confused as to how the insole and the support features of the shoe interact,” says Matt Gooch. “The inside of most shoes is relatively flat. So, the anatomical, three-dimensional Superfeet shape built into our insoles can interact with the foot in ways that a shoe by itself cannot. Our insoles fill in the empty space under the foot, increasing contact surface area and helping to redistribute forces to reduce stress and strain on your entire body, not just your feet.""</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles offer contoured support that hugs your arches and cradles your heels while energizing foam cushions your whole foot for ultimate comfort in a variety of shoes. The <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"">signature Superfeet shape</a> allows your feet to move the way they are supposed to. ""We make a wide variety of insoles to ensure that we can fit every foot and fit in every shoe. For over 40 years, Superfeet insoles have delivered essential, life-changing shape under the feet of our customers,"" says Matt Gooch.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety <span>of Superfeet products for improving foot health and comfort, including</span> insoles designed for <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/pain-relief"">pain relief</a> or insoles engineered for specific activities like <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">running</a>, <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"">hiking</a>, <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/snow-sports"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/snow-sports"">winter sports</a> and <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"">hockey</a>.

<h2>Tips for Maintaining Good Foot Health</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Keeping your feet healthy and comfortable is vital to your overall health and well-being. Regular checkups with a podiatrist can ensure you’re getting the care you need but there are also things you can do on your own to maintain good foot health. Here are a few tips to help keep your feet happy and feeling good.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>While overexertion can cause pain, not doing enough can be detrimental to your foot health as well. It’s important to walk, run, or participate in other activities to keep the muscles in your feet strong and healthy. Strong muscles are more resilient and less prone to injury.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Stretching</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Stretching the muscles in your feet is an important addition to exercising. Stretching keeps your feet loose and flexible, preventing tears. Stretching can also help alleviate the pain of certain foot conditions, like these <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"">stretches for plantar fasciitis</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Footwear and Insoles</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Stretching and exercise won’t mean much if the cause of your pain is unsupportive footwear. Chances are, your pain won’t go away or could get worse. With the right combination of shoes and supportive insoles, your feet can truly live their best life.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Don't Neglect Your Feet</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Your feet are the foundation of your body. They keep you upright while standing and propel you forward as you walk. They are vital to how we as humans experience the world. And yet, their importance can sometimes get taken for granted – until they’re in pain. Foot aches, soreness, and general discomfort that keep you from working or enjoying your favorite activities reveal the huge part our feet play in our daily lives.</p>
<p>That’s why keeping your feet healthy goes a long way in keeping your whole body <span>healthy. Don't neglect your feet – prioritize foot care for better overall health and well-being. Giving your feet proper support and cushioning, no matter the shoes your wearing, is a key part of that. Whether you’re specifically seeking out insoles and inserts for reducing foot pain and discomfort, or ju</span>st want your feet to be as comfortable as they can be, Superfeet insoles provide the arch structure, heel support, and cushioning that leave your feet feeling better than they’ve ever felt before.</p>

<p>Summer is starting to heat up and before we know it the thick cloud of humidity will soon take over Philadelphia, but lets not forget that fall marathon training is just around the corner for many Philly runners. Luckily, there are plenty of scenic places for runners to choose from in and around Philly as they ramp up long-run mileage each weekend. Whether it’s a sunny, paved pathway or a shaded, gravel trail, make sure to hit up one of these top 5 spots for Philly long runs this training season.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>1. THE LOOP (KELLY DRIVE AND MLK JR. DRIVE)</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/bxj5jrkpomvr6z52dlux.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Philadelphia's famous loop trail offers some of the best views of the city. <small><a href=""https://emilysphillyphavs.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fairmount.jpg"">Phree Philly</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>The most obvious and popular spot on our list is worth noting first, as it’s a rite of passage for every marathoner—from the first time novice to the experienced Boston Qualifier. Start the 8.4-mile loop at the Art Museum, head north up Kelly Drive on the east side of the river to white Falls Bridge. Cross over the river to MLK Jr. Drive (West River Drive) and head back down to the Art Museum to finish the loop while catching a beautiful view of famous Boathouse Row. This loop provides almost no shade, but you might get a nice breeze off the river on a windy day. During the warmer months, there are a few water fountains on the trail—one at Lloyd Hall, one just south of the Falls Bridge, and one on MLK Jr. Drive near Montgomery Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS MILES:</strong> Tack a couple extra miles onto your long run in Center City by continuing south on the beautiful Schuylkill Banks, which runs behind the Art Museum next to the river, all the way down to South Street. Alternatively, head onto Main Street in Manyunk at the north end of the loop, and connect with the Manayunk Tow Path, which runs along the Schuylkill Canal.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>2. FORBIDDEN DRIVE</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/hal1he5essu2v7izprzl.jpg"">

<p>Not too far from The Loop lies Forbidden Drive, a 5.5-mile dirt and crushed stone path that snakes through Wissahickon Valley Park alongside the Wissahickon Creek. In the warm summer months, this wide, shaded, mixed-use trail is a lovely escape from the hot city streets. For a fairly flat 11 mile out and back run, park on either end of the trail at Northwestern Avenue in Chestnut Hill or off of Lincoln Drive in Manayunk. If you're feeling adventurous, split off onto one of the many singletrack side trails in the park, just be prepared for some rocky, rooty, and hilly terrain.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS MILES: </strong> Once you hit the Manayunk end of Forbidden Drive, where it meets busy Lincoln Drive, head right down the bridge and connect to the 1.5-mile Wissahickon Bike Trail. When you hit Ridge Avenue, head right down Main Street in Manayunk or cross Ridge Ave and continue along the Kelly Drive to connect with The Loop.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>3. VALLEY FORGE NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK</strong></p>
<p>If you're training for a hilly race, Valley Forge is the place to be. This National Park contains almost 30 miles of trails of all terrain. The most popular route for marathon training is undoubtedly the Joseph Plumb Martin Trail, which contains a hilly, paved 5-mile loop around the park. Though difficult, this loop is worth the sweeping scenic views of the meadows where Revolutionary soldiers once camped. If it’s trails you’re looking for, head to Mount Joy or Mount Misery for miles of steep singletrack. Be sure to check out a <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/vafo/planyourvisit/maps.htm"">map</a>and plan your route before heading out.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS MILES: </strong> Connect to the <a href=""http://schuylkillrivertrail.com/"">Schuylkill River Trail</a>, which runs along the river all the way into Center City Philadelphia, or the <a href=""http://www.montcopa.org/perkiomentrail"">Perkiomen Trail</a>, which runs 20 miles north through Montgomery County.</p>

<div>
<div>Every runner knows the feeling of pushing through discomfort, but when that nagging pain in your foot refuses to fade, it might be more than just typical muscle soreness.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>If you're experiencing persistent foot pain that worsens with activity, you could be dealing with a stress fracture—a microscopic crack in your bone that can sideline you for months if left untreated. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Stress fractures are among the most common overuse injuries in runners, accounting for up to 20% of all sports medicine clinic visits.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Unlike a sudden traumatic break, these hairline cracks develop gradually from repetitive stress and overuse.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Not to worry—at Superfeet, our entire goal is to keep you running. </div>
<div><br></div>
<h3>What Causes Stress Fractures? The Perfect Storm of Risk Factors </h3>
<div>Stress fractures rarely result from a single cause. Instead, they typically develop from a combination of factors that collectively overwhelm your bone's ability to withstand repetitive forces. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Training Errors and Overuse: </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>The ""too much, too soon"" principle is the leading cause of stress fractures in runners. Your bones need time to adapt to increased loads through the natural bone remodeling process.  </div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div><strong>Biomechanical Imbalances: </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>How your foot interacts with the ground significantly influences stress distribution throughout your bones. Subtle biomechanical issues can create abnormal loading patterns that predispose specific bones to stress fractures.  </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Equipment and Environmental Factors: </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Your running shoes are your first line of defense against impact forces. Worn-out shoes that have lost their cushioning and structural support leave your bones vulnerable to excessive stress. Most experts recommend replacing running shoes every 300-500 miles, but this varies based on your weight, running style, and the surfaces you run on. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Hard running surfaces like concrete and asphalt generate more impact forces than softer surfaces like dirt trails or tracks.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>While you can't always control your running environment, varying your surfaces when possible can help distribute stress more evenly across your bones. </div>
<div></div>
<h3>How Superfeet Premium Insoles Help Prevent and Manage Stress Fractures </h3>
<div>While proper medical care is essential for healing existing stress fractures, the right support system plays a crucial role in both pain management during recovery and long-term injury prevention.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Superfeet premium insoles are specifically engineered to address the biomechanical factors that contribute to stress fractures. </div>
<div><br></div>
<h4>Superior Biomechanical Support </h4>
<div>Unlike generic foam insoles that simply provide cushioning, Superfeet insoles are structured biomechanical devices designed to optimize your foot function.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>The signature deep heel cup cradles your heel's natural fat pad, promoting proper shock absorption and stabilizing your foot and ankle alignment. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This foundational support creates a chain reaction of proper positioning throughout your kinetic chain—from your foot through your knee and into your hip.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>By improving overall biomechanical efficiency, Superfeet insoles reduce the aberrant forces and uneven pressure distribution that commonly lead to stress fractures in the metatarsals, navicular, and other vulnerable bones. </div>
<div><br></div>
<h4>Even Pressure Distribution </h4>
<div>One of the key mechanisms behind stress fractures is concentrated pressure on specific bones. Superfeet insoles are engineered to distribute impact forces evenly across your entire foot, rather than allowing pressure to concentrate on vulnerable areas like the second and third metatarsals. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This even distribution is particularly beneficial for runners who may experience excessive overpronation or have very high arches. By creating a more stable platform and optimizing pressure distribution, Superfeet insoles help prevent the repetitive microtrauma that leads to stress fractures. </div>
<div><br></div>
<h4>Enhanced Shock Absorption </h4>
<div>The firm, structured support of Superfeet insoles doesn't just provide stability—it also enhances your foot's natural shock absorption capabilities. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The deep heel cup and biomechanical shape work together to optimize how your foot contacts and pushes off from the ground, reducing the repetitive stress that accumulates over thousands of running steps. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is especially important during the gradual return-to-activity phase after a stress fracture, when your bones are still adapting to increased loads. The additional support and shock absorption can help protect healing bone tissue and prevent re-injury. </div>
<div><br></div>
<h4>Improved Muscle Function</h4>
<p>Superfeet insoles help optimize muscle function throughout your lower extremity by providing a stable foundation for movement. </p>
<p>Strong, well-functioning muscles are one of your best defenses against stress fractures, as they help dissipate the repetitive forces that would otherwise stress your bones. </p>
<h4>Long-Term Prevention Strategy </h4>
<div>Perhaps most importantly, Superfeet insoles address the underlying biomechanical issues that contribute to stress fractures. By providing consistent, reliable support day after day, they help prevent the accumulation of repetitive stress that leads to bone damage over time. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This makes Superfeet insoles an excellent investment for runners who want to proactively protect their bone health and avoid the frustrating cycle of injury and recovery that sidelines so many athletes. </div>

<p>The forests can swallow you up, the rocky mountain scrambles can shred your shoes, and the slick and rooted paths will cover your legs in mud. Yet the rugged, and at times, unforgiving Pacific Northwest is an uncaged trail running kingdom that will deliver bliss with its boundless variety of terrain, style, and difficulty.</p>
<div>
<p>It would take a trail runner several lifetimes to fully experience the region. So here are some of the highlights to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>MAPLE PASS LOOP, WA</strong></p>
<p><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--VveifbMt--/t_rr_large_traditional/qpmmu5supxyz56f1wp3m.jpg""><sub><sup>Maple Pass. <small><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookpeterson/21569353540/in/photolist-HQEA3D-HFtNMn-Hb9Vuq-Hb9UHq-HwCibU-HFtNBT-GQpoys-HQ7x9G-GQpoNA-HwCixW-HQ7wxw-HQ7xyE-HwCiU7-HFtNkF-HFtNu8-HzE1Ue-HREuAF-HREuaR-HzdbFw-HQ7wPy-aeRsRX-aeRw82-aeUjvb-Hzdccw-8Denu-aeUjMC-aeUhDj-aeRt96-aeUhk3-aeUhY1-aeUfP7-HCWwHY-aeUguW-8DejG-ycAsbb-yS1zkS-zasc9e-z8Ammu-yS7gT4"">brookpeterson</a></small></sup></sub></p>
<p>A well-worn groove through a carpet of heather-covered slopes in the heart of the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/insider-s-guide-to-north-cascades-national-park"">North Cascades</a>, the <a href=""http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/maple-pass"">Maple Pass Loop</a> is a 7.2-mile trail that will embrace you between granite peaks and glaciated mountains. Snow free by late July, the trail’s most striking feature is the golden larch conifers that turn a brilliant yellow and colorfully awaken the landscape in early fall.</p>
<p>The trail is moderate and well maintained, but has the occasional rocky and rooted sections. It will deliver you from shaded forest to exposed and breezy ridgelines where alpine lakes mirror the clouds above. Overall, the route gains 2,200 feet to an elevation of roughly 6,650 feet. Those looking to pound through the elevation the quickest should consider running the circuit clockwise.</p>
<p><strong>LOVER’S LANE, WA</strong></p>
<p><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--vJGdAWTH--/t_rr_large_traditional/gp7nfotf5foblse1ux2r.jpg""><sub><sup>Sol Duc Falls. <small><a href=""http://outdoor-society.com/"">Douglas Scott</a></small></sup></sub></p>
<p>Huffing your way through rain-soaked spruce and ferns, watching your breath mix with the misty air of a temperate rainforest, can be a sensational running experience even if the showers refuse to recede. The six-mile round trip <a href=""http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lovers-lane-loop"">Lover’s Lane Trail</a> surrounds you with a swell of wildly lush moss and emerald evergreens that almost take over the trail beneath your feet.</p>
<p>While the rain can hamper your pace, this is one of the easier trail runs in the notoriously technical <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/the-enchanted-valley-of-the-olympics"">Olympics</a>. With only 550 feet of elevation gain, and minimal switchbacks or turns, you are given the chance to take in more of the old-growth forest and potentially glimpse at migrating salmon below. There is also nothing more rewarding than a post-run dip in the nearby Sol Duc Hot Springs.</p>
<p><strong>ROGUE RIVER, OR</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.blm.gov/or/resources/recreation/rogue/rogue-river-trail.php"">Rogue River Trail</a> is a ribbon of dirt and fine gravel that gently ebbs and flows like the bubbling river it overlooks. The scenery and wildlife are in constant flux as lush forests sheltering black-tailed deer give way to rolling meadows and steep canyon walls above watery pools with playful river otters.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>At a little over 40 miles point-to-point, with forgiving elevation gains that keep you under 1,000 feet, many who run through this wilderness elect to split up the distance over a few days in order to take advantage of one of the riverside lodges. Shuttles can be arranged to deliver you back to the starting point at the Grave Creek Campground. Rafting can be added to the trip through a local guide service.</p>

<p>Many who live in the Pacific Northwest agree the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/seattle-wa/backpacking-camping/the-enchantments"">Enchantments</a> are utterly mesmerizing spectacle that cannot be missed. Trail running will give you the access needed to witness theit splendor when overnight camping permits are in short supply. The entire traverse, normally starting out at the Stuart Lake Trailhead and ending at the Snow Lakes Trailhead, will challenge you for almost 20 miles, 5,000 feet of elevation gain, and sections of steep rocky technical terrain. Other shorter but still rewarding options, include Colchuck Lake (an eight-mile roundtrip) or Snow Lakes (14 miles out and back).</p>
<p>Whichever route you decide on striking views will be encountered. The tightness in your quads and shortness of breath will be forgotten the moment you lay eyes on the coliseum of jagged granite peaks enclosing deep turquoise lakes and golden larches.

<p>Within the Columbia River Gorge there is an ample selection of trails that will keep you absorbed regardless of the weather, and Eagle Creek Trail is one of the more exhilarating options that you can choose. A 12-mile out-and-back trail that gains 1,650 feet, Eagle Creek claims it notoriety from the precipitous drop-offs and numerous cascading waterfalls along its path. The trail eventually weaves its way up the canyon to the plummeting water of Tunnel Falls.</p>
<p>You may lose track of the number of waterfalls you pass. But don’t lose your footing or become gripped with vertigo, especially when the trail is slick and muddy. And while challenging in the rain, the Eagle Creek Trail embodies the spirit of trail running in the Pacific Northwest and will motivate you to explore more of this region.</p>

<p><em>Written by: Paul Langer, DPM. Dr. Langer is a sports medicine podiatrist who treats athletes of all abilities at <a href=""https://tcomn.com/"" title=""https://tcomn.com/"">Twin Cities Orthopedics</a> in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is the author Great Feet for Life and lectures internationally on the topics of lower extremity health and footwear.</em></p>
</div>
<div><hr></div>
<div>
<p>The importance of wearing comfortable shoes cannot be overstated.<br><br><a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"" title=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"">Research</a> shows that we use less energy, are less likely to sustain an injury or fall and we perform better in sports and fitness activities when wearing comfortable shoes. Comfortable footwear is also important in helping us recover from strenuous activity, foot pain or injuries.<br><br>The concept of comfort is very complex, and there is no single aspect of fit that is more important than others. In fact, individuals tend to prioritize comfort features differently. For example, some people prefer cushioning and don’t notice arch support. Others may say that if the shoe or sandal supports their arch well, they will like it. Fashion of course also influences how we select shoes — some people are willing to sacrifice comfort for style.</p>
<p>Because comfort is highly subjective and thus can’t be measured, I tell my patients to try on several pairs of shoes, make comparisons and then to trust their instinct on which shoes or insoles have the fit, feel and overall comfort they prefer, instead of relying on someone else to tell them what to wear.</p>
<p>I also emphasize that comfort decreases from standing to walking to running so you should move in the shoes or sandals to accurately assess how they feel.</p>
<p>Research suggests that part of <a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"" title=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"">how we perceive comfort in footwear</a> has to do with how efficiently we move with the shoes on. If the shoe works with our body’s preferred movement pattern, we will move more efficiently and will perceive it to be more comfortable. Conversely, if the shoe works against our preferred movement pattern, we will move less efficiently and will perceive the shoe to be less comfortable.</p>
<p>Again, this comfort measurement is highly subjective and personal. I encourage people to trust their instincts on comfort after making comparisons.</p>
</div>
<h2>Factors that affect comfort in footwear</h2>
<div>
<p>Some of the factors that affect comfort in footwear include fit, cushioning, support, stiffness and climate.</p>
</div>
<h3>Fit</h3>
<div>
<p>Matching the shape of the shoe to the shape of the foot in terms of length, width and volume, is an important starting point. Keep in mind that shoe size is inconsistent across brands, so focus more on how the shoe feels, instead of the size number. A recent study found that up to 72% of people are wearing shoes that do not fit them properly. The same study showed that improperly fitting shoes are associated with foot pain. For runners, I emphasize a fit that is snug in the heel and midfoot but allows room for the toes -- the back 2/3 of the shoe should be snug and the toe box should feel roomy.</p>
</div>
<h3>Cushioning</h3>
<div>
<p>There is probably an ideal amount of cushioning for each individual, but we do not have a method of measuring for it. Some people like a lot and some like a little — the “right” amount is whatever you prefer. One concept to keep in mind however is that there is such a thing as too much cushioning. Excessively soft shoes are rarely the answer to address foot pain or injuries.</p>
</div>
<h3>Support</h3>
<div>
<p>This term means different things to different people but often refers to how it feels in the arch and midfoot. As with cushioning, the “right” amount is based on your personal preference.</p>
</div>
<h3>Stiffness</h3>
<div>
<p>Some shoes are very flexible and some are stiff, the way the shoe flexes under the foot is dependent on the structure of the midsole and outsole as well as the size of the person and the speed at which they run. There is no single ideal amount of stiffness in footwear, so the best method is to run in the shoe and select the style that feels most comfortable to you.</p>
</div>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<div>
<p>The shoe’s upper must allow proper dissipation of heat and moisture to help maintain comfort and protection from the environment. Running shoes tend to be very breathable while hiking boots tend to be more weather resistant and less breathable. A quality pair of socks with wicking properties definitely help maximize footwear comfort in combination with the shoe.</p>
<p>In summary, comfort isn’t just about feeling good. There are many health benefits to wearing comfortable shoes. In order to find the best shoe for you, make comparisons, run in the shoes and trust your instincts to determine your personal preferences.</p>

"589638828215","5-gorgeous-waterfall-hikes-around-portland","MERGE","Winter Wonderland: 5 Gorgeous Waterfall Hikes Around Portland","Superfeet","<p>Portland-area hikers face a challenge every fall and winter: How do you stay active on the trails when so many hikes depend on nice weather to unveil breathtaking viewpoints? Given that we're solidly in the midst of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/rainy-day-fun-10-reasons-love-rainy-season-in-portland"">Oregon's rainy season</a> once again, can hikers really hope for sun breaks to illuminate clifftop views and other spectacular viewpoints throughout the region?</p>
<p>Probably not. But that doesn't mean you have to put away the hiking boots for another six months. The Columbia River Gorge and Willamette Valley are home to some of the most beautiful waterfall hikes around Portland (and beyond) that look great in any weather and are usually accessible year-round—and the steady rainfall means powerful, scenic waterfalls all winter long.</p>
<p>Here, five of our favorites, from a new twist on the well-worn Multnomah Falls hike to the underrated Dry Creek Falls trip near Cascade Locks.</p>
<h2>1. Eagle Creek</h2>
<h6>Hikers get to walk behind the impressive Tunnel Falls along the Eagle Creek Trail.<small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/mjfmjfmjf/15929232748/in/photolist-qgBtVW-6CWwUf-6CWzSq-6CWw41-ptbtPQ-pt8TRp-ptc1ai-pte38W-dVZDSp-pt8Rpk-pte2xY-pte51J-pte4Hj-732JvA-bxoNGA-6CSoea-bLiuz2-bLiuy4-h6qpAr-bLiuA2-bxoNC3-ptc24x-ptbsiU-oNPTPP-pt8QNR-4ZML6K-4ZMDPT-4ZMHqk-4ZRRsN-4ZMEW4-4ZMBMM-4ZMGaT-nnQfy9-nE7qiy-7PQ5sa-7PQ5wM-7PThXh-7PQ5pK-7PThQN-bxoNFJ-bLiuwc-bLiuuZ-bLiuug-bLiutt-pBpWk6-qvTTmA-9cHYyu-9cHCW7-9cJ1Vo-2D4uSd"">Mitchell Friedman</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/portland-or/backpacking-camping/eagle-creek"">Eagle Creek Trail</a> is among the finest treks in the Columbia River Gorge, and for good reason: The hike introduces outdoor enthusiasts to roughly 20 waterfalls (some more dramatic than others) over the first seven miles, delivers awe-inspiring canyon views, and can be done as a quick day hike or longer weekend adventure. Punchbowl Falls provides an ideal turnaround spot for those pressed for time, but the 175-foot Tunnel Falls is the trail's crown jewel for serious day hikers.</p>
<p><a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-ever-popular-eagle-creek-trail"">Eagle Creek</a> is worth a standalone visit on its own any time of year, but the recent rains—which give the trees and plants their vibrant hues of green and bolster the raging waterfalls—only add to the charm in fall and winter.</p>
<h2>2. Trail of Ten Falls</h2>
<h6>Silver Falls State Park promises up-close glimpses of 10 beautiful waterfalls.<small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/13027149863/in/photolist-kRaxN8-bfzMRZ-bfzAMT-8AkaN6-a5BQx-a5BT3-a5BN7-a5BU3-8d8h9j-4gB9dG-4gx6gX-89x9n4-8c2NnJ-85mm9d-85mdtU-85ibC2-85mcG3-a2AACW-91q74X-gmBp8N-gmB1T7-gmALUW-gmAvfj-gmzTRd-gmzc5y-gmz4Jm-gmxWB7-gmxUss-gmxye1-gmxgZh-gmwNNo-gmwmNh-gmvVBq-gmvLNJ-85mmW1-85i8dp-85mg9f-85mfdm-85i5B8-85mcxf-dgzdoR-85mdzw-85i9vk-85idVe-8aNcu5-8aJTzx-8aNd6h-8aNc1N-qWcVuB-8aN9YQ"">Stuart Seeger</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Silver Falls State Park attracts nearly a million visitors every year, and it's not hard to see why: The 8.7-mile <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/portland-or/hiking/trail-of-ten-falls"">Trail of Ten Falls loop hike</a> delivers better waterfall views—and more of them—than just about any waterfall hike in the state. Ten majestic waterfalls range from 27 to 177 feet tall along the route, but hikers get to enjoy deep, opal pools, lush, green canyon views, and well-maintained trails in between viewpoints.</p>
<p>Even better: The falls become more majestic as winter wears on, thanks largely to ongoing rain. The appropriately-named Winter Falls, for instance, is a leaky faucet every summer (when crowds are at their heaviest), but weeks or months of regular rainfall turns it into a memorable destination in the colder months.</p>

<h2>3. Dry Creek Falls</h2>
<h6>Dry Creek Falls falls into a creek that once served as the water source for the nearby town of Cascade Locks.<small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmiske/22678359972/in/photolist-Ay1wjq-qheZQV-qgN9qk-qh835h-qgDAj3-qheZCR-qgLxUk-qgLyjP-qh84zb-pBG4RN-pBVuN4-qheXzH-pBdycw-qgDzUA-qhgC4n-qhgBXk-qwpodL-qheWnn-asyNt9-ataJaf-pBG3PY-pBG3o7-qgEeUf-qh8Gqh-qheWy4-2X1sYR-2X5YcE-2X1wiM-2X5X4o-2X5Uwo-2X5TKs-2X1rJT-2X5Smd-2X1vfB-2X1uye-2X1u3p-2X1tKx-2X1oUX-2X1xCF-efv6Ud-efvexo-efveoQ-efvejL-efptYT-efvdYA-efptBR-efvdBd-efvdom-efpt3M-efvcYm"">Jonathan Miske</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>You can be forgiven for wondering if you're in the right place before setting out on the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/portland-or/hiking/dry-creek-falls"">Dry Creek Falls</a> hike: The trailhead sits in the shadow of the impressive Bridge of the Gods in Cascade Locks. But it won't take long before you're in the midst of dense woods and en route to one of the hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. It's a leisurely 2.2-mile hike (which offers beautiful fall colors every autumn and vibrant wildflower displays every spring), and the destination is a 75-foot waterfall that cascades over a wall of (appropriately-named) columnar basalt.</p>
<p>Take note: The Bridge of the Gods trailhead is closed during the winter months, so hikers may need to start on nearby Moody Street.</p>
<h2>4. Horsetail/Triple Falls</h2>
<h6>The creek feeding Triple Falls breaks into three separate streams before falling 100 or more feet below.<small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glamourschatz/6128998448/in/photolist-qiVCjw-qj5g4X-qj5fQv-qiVBLs-qiWn6f-pDJ4ST-pDJ4PM-civHay-civGPu-civGk7-civFRN-civDjf-cxmeeC-cxmdGE-cxmdAh-cxmdrj-cxmd5h-cxmcNL-cxmbS3-qiWmtd-qj3CN4-9QFEpz-eotR4B-87pGxQ-87mvQ8-87mvJK-87pGMw-87mvei-nMyfB-e8eTii-p8gstL-ppJDvC-akAL9o-akAKzq-akxWrx-akxWh6-akxW9R-akAK1u-akAJSJ-akAJAm-akxV24-akAHH3-akAHy1-akxUbr-akxTXz-nSMz9K-oa8bY3-oafToZ-ovzdhT-53PmU6"">Angel Schatz</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/portland-or/hiking/the-horsetail-triple-falls-loop"">Horsetail Falls/Triple Falls Loop</a> introduces hikers to two of the most popular waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge. Horsetail Falls is beloved for its jaw-dropping 176-foot drop and proximity to Interstate 84 and Historic Columbia River Highway; Triple Falls, meanwhile, is one of the most-photographed waterfalls in the region, thanks to its unusual shape.</p>
<p>The Triple Falls trail challenges hikers with a trek that dabbles in extremes: Its leisurely, flat trail takes hikers through lush forests dotted with big leaf maple trees, but steep switchbacks make for an occasionally grueling hike. The payoff is worth it, though: Each of Triple Falls' three streams range from 100 to 135 feet, and—somewhat unusual for a waterfall—they're are surrounded by massive trees and electric green moss.</p>
<h2>5. Wahkeena Falls/Multnomah Falls</h2>
<h6>Multnomah Falls, with peaceful hiking trails, unforgettable views, and a picturesque lodge, makes for a fun Valentine's Day outing.<small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/49580580@N02/21142944265"">Thomas Shahan, mods made</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>An article about Portland-area waterfall hikes would be woefully incomplete without a nod toward Multnomah Falls, which is consistently ranked as one of the busiest—if not <em>the</em> busiest—tourist attraction in the state. You've probably visited before and may even have a few shots dotting your Instagram feed. But the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/portland-or/hiking/the-wahkeena-multnomah-loop"">Wahkeena Falls/Multnomah Falls Loop</a> promises a new take on the classic trip.</p>
<p>Rather than fight the crowds at the base of the 630-foot Multnomah Falls, park near Wahkeena Falls and take the trail from there. It more or less hugs the waterfalls through a series of switchbacks before leveling out and entering Wahkeena Canyon. The trail gets pretty level from here and even passes a few other picturesque waterfalls before descending the Multnomah Falls trail (where you'll pass by jeans-clad tourists on their way up). A quick return trail connects the Multnomah Falls and Wahkeena Falls parking lots, making for a quick, safe return just off the Historic Columbia River Highway.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"">Plantar fasciitis</a> is inflammation caused by excessive stretching of the plantar fascia, the connective tissue that runs the length of the bottom of your foot, connecting your toes to your heels. The plantar fascia's main job is to absorb shock and support your foot arch —it’s known as the spring ligament. The plantar fascia plays a crucial role in helping your foot transition into the propulsion or the push off phase of your gait cycle.</p>
<p>If you're one of those unfortunate runners or athletes who's struggling with plantar fasciitis, you're most likely going to feel that pain in your heel, and it's most likely that pain is going to occur in the mornings when you're first waking up and stepping out of bed, or after a really long day spent on your feet.</p>
<p>Here’s how figure out where your plantar fasciitis came from, and give you a few ways to help you get over that pain and prevent it from coming back in the future.</p>
</div>
<h2>What causes plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<div>
<p>A drastic increase in your weekly mileage and/or weak or tight calves that cause your foot to work harder to flex especially during walking, running, or prolonged standing, can cause plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>An unstable foot, or any instability of the kinetic chain, like in your knees or hips, can also put additional strain on the plantar fascia.</p>
</div>
<h2>Strengthening Exercises to Help Prevent Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s first talk about some preventative exercises that you can do for your calves and your feet to make them strong and stable, and able to handle that repetitive intensity on those lower muscles in your body. Be sure to warm up before you start these exercises — try a light jog, some jumping jacks and even running in place to get those feet warmed up.</p>
</div>
<h3>Calf Raises</h3>
<figure><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Fix_Your_Plantar_Fasciitis_Pain.mp4-low.gif"" alt=""Woman demonstrating calf raises outdoors on an orange exercises mat"" style=""float: none;""></figure>
<div>
<p>Stand upright and keep your shoulders rolled down and back, really engaging your core. Feel the weight in your heels and then slowly roll up to stand on your toes. Keep the movement slow and controlled. Pause at the top before slowly lowering down. You want a full range of motion in this exercise so be sure to move through it slowly — rushing will do you no good. We suggest taking your shoes off for this exercise. You can do three to four rounds of these calf raises, and add them in three to four times a week as they shouldn't leave you sore and achy. This is a great exercises to squeeze in while you are doing other things — I like to do these while I'm doing the dishes, brushing my teeth, etc.</p>
</div>
<h3>Calf Raise Variation — Harder</h3>
<div>
<p>To make this strengthening exercise harder, try doing this entire exercise one leg at a time. It's a little trickier to maintain your balance on a single leg, so feel free to use the wall to stabilize yourself. As with the other variation, be sure you have an engaged core, with shoulders rolled back. Another variation is to stay on two feet at the beginning, for the ""up"" part of the exercises, then shift to one foot and slowly lower down.</p>
</div>
<h3>Toe Extensions</h3>
<figure><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Woman demostrating toe exensions with a band, sitting on an orange exercise mat"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Fix_Your_Plantar_Fasciitis_Pain.mp4-low_4_63783b18-ace3-463a-a5c0-7a92eb1a7ba6_480x480.gif?v=1733496445""></figure>
<div>
<p>For this exercise, you'll want to take your shoes off and grab a band or towel. No need for special equipment — just look for something that flexes with a little bit of give. You are going to be in a seated position, legs extended out in front of you, with a gentle bend in your knees. Wrap the band or towel around the bottom of your foot at the toe and then start to point and flex your foot, providing gentle resistance with the band as you move. You want slow, controlled movements. You are not only working on strengthening your calves with this exercise, you are also focusing on controlling all the little muscles in the toes and giving them a good stretch at the same time. For this exercise, do about 30 seconds on, with 10 to 15 seconds of rest in between each side. Like the calf raises, you can incorporate these movements three to four days per week.</p>
</div>
<h2>Exercises for Plantar Fasciitis Relief</h2>
<div>
<p>Here are a couple exercises that can help provide relief for those who are suffering from plantar fasciitis pain. Often, tight calves can pull on the plantar fascia and make pain worse. These exercises can help loosen tight calves.</p>
</div>
<h3>Broomstick Bash</h3>
<figure><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Fix_Your_Plantar_Fasciitis_Pain.mp4-low_5_b076f6af-6002-41b6-a3fa-b5e6d08b78d3_480x480.gif?v=1733496445"" alt=""Woman demonstrating broomstick bash exercises outdoors while kneeling on an exercise mat"" style=""float: none;""></figure>
<div>
<p>You can use a roller stick, or a broomstick for this exercise, like the name suggests (but please, don't really bash anything — that's just a play on words). Kneel down, sitting back on your heels and put the stick down towards the bottom of your legs. Slowing move the stick back and forth, working up your legs slowly. For more intensity, you can sit back on your calves, adding pressure from above. Continue rolling your calves for five to seven minutes. As an option, if there is too much pressure, you can roll one leg at a time.</p>
</div>
<h3>Toe Towel Grab</h3>
<figure><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Fix_Your_Plantar_Fasciitis_Pain.mp4-low_6_3c313f5f-5a2b-4091-b8c5-580d14a534b2_480x480.gif?v=1733496445"" alt=""Demonstrating a toe towel grab exercise"" style=""float: none;""></figure>
<div>
<p>For this exercise, you will again need a band or towel. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you with bent knees. You'll want to do this exercise with bare feet. Put your right foot at the end of the towel or band. Extend your toes forward and try to scrunch the towel with your toes and pull it back towards you. Continue extending, gripping and pulling back until you've reached the end of the towel. Plan to work each foot for about 30 seconds or so on each side.</p>

<p>Longtime fans know the incredible comfort and support their favorite Superfeet provide, and every day, new wearers find out how much Superfeet can help relieve pain not just in their feet, but in their joints and back as well. If you’re still looking for your first pair, <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"">this quiz</a> can help find the right insoles for you. In our blog series Superfeet: Steps Ahead, devoted and new wearers alike can find out the top reasons Superfeet stand out from other insoles.</p>
<p>Today’s topic is all about the signature shape of Superfeet and why your feet need more than just arch support. With structure that goes all the way through to the back of your heel, Superfeet insoles offer support for your entire rearfoot, helping reduce vibrations that can lead to fatigue.</p>
<p>Find out what happens when Superfeet structure is tested alongside four other insoles in the video below.</p>

<div>
<h2>Arch and Heel Support – Better Together</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Most insoles only focus on the arch and place a single hill of support right in the middle. But the landscape of your foot is more nuanced and requires the right anatomically-designed shape to give you full support from heel to toe. If the structure of your insole doesn’t continue all the way through to the back of the heel, your feet are missing out on a critically important comfort and performance element.</p>
<p>Having one cohesive support structure underneath both your arch and heel helps keep your feet stable as you move, allowing for more efficient strides, meaning you can cover more distance with less effort, and reducing vibrations that can lead to fatigue. Even the softest, most flexible Superfeet have durable structure that give your feet the support they need.</p>
</div>
<figure><picture> <source> <img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Image illustrating the use of a kettlebell weight to simulate just some of the forces acting on your feet as you move."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/SFSA_ArchShape_Thumbnail.jpg""></picture><picture> </picture></figure>
<div>
<h2>Superfeet Shape – Your Bridge to Comfort</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>As explained in the video, a bridge is only as good as the forces it can withstand and the same goes for the arch and heel of your foot. Without proper structure underneath, the tissue in your feet can become strained as it flattens out with every step, causing soreness and sometimes debilitating pain.</p>
<p>We used a kettlebell weight to simulate just some of the forces acting on your feet as you move. The single weight provided a simple, straightforward test that we could replicate across insoles. The reasoning was simple: if an insole had enough structure to bridge the gap between both cinder blocks (and thus could support your arch and heel together), it would hold the weight. If not, it would fall to the ground.</p>
<p>We didn’t have much hope for the factory shoe sockliner or flimsy gel insole and sure enough, they crumpled immediately under the weight of the kettlebell. Squishy gel may feel good at first, but it won’t do anything to prevent or relieve pain in the long run. Even the insole that provides some arch structure fell because that structure did not continue through to the back of the heel. Having full rearfoot support in every step is the best thing you can do to prevent or relieve pain, take more efficient strides, and feel good even after a long day on your feet.</p>
<p>Both firm and flexible Superfeet insoles held the weight of the kettlebell. People love the firm foundation of <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"">Superfeet All-Purpose</a> insoles, but even <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">Superfeet Run Cushion</a> insoles give your feet structured support while also flexing with your feet as you move. Whatever your comfort preference, you can find the support you need with Superfeet.</p>

<p>We doubt we're the only ones planning to kick off the summer with a trip to a national park. Even if this wasn’t the centennial year for the U.S. Park Service, millions of Americans could be expected to hit the road with their  families and friends to see and enjoy some of our collectively held and cherished landscape.</p>
<p>But while we share everyone else's love for the national park system, we dislike dealing with everyone else in the same places. So we’ve assembled a list of seven of the best U.S. parks to visit in June, with tips on how to find beauty and solitude in each.</p>
<p>June can deliver unbearably high temperatures, unfortunately. So we’ve deliberately left off the list popular parks such Joshua Tree and Death Valley in California, although surely there are fans of consecutive 100-plus-degree days. For those who prefer less scorching environments, here are our top picks.</p>
<p><strong>Yosemite National Park</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/ncmmfhya2qlnq4uejvrk.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Standing tall in Yosemite. <small><a href=""http://cam%20adams/"">Cam Adams</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>As popular as Yosemite National Park is—attracting some 3.3 million people annually and 14,000 on any given summer’s day—it’s easy to escape the throngs and take in the majestic snow-capped peaks in isolation. Ninety percent of park visitors pack themselves into the mall that is Yosemite Village in the southern third of the park. That leaves most of the 800 miles of marked trails through California’s High Sierras to explore in relative peace.</p>
<p>The campgrounds are typically full July through August, so make sure to find lodging in advance. This is essential, as the full breadth of Yosemite can’t be adequately experienced in a single day. Certainly take a shuttle bus to the Valley Visitor Center in the village to get your bearings, but don’t waste much time in the shops. Allow yourself to lured away by the promise of blooming lupine, redbud, and Mariposa lilies.</p>
<p>The crowds correspond with the peak flow over the park’s awesome waterfalls in May and June. So pick a week day to experience the melting snowpack at higher elevations thunder down Yosemite Falls, the highest in North America and second highest in the world at 2,425 feet. The Lower Yosemite Fall is easiest to get to, but a challenging 3.6-mile hike is required to get to the Upper Yosemite Fall and spectacular views of the valley.</p>
<p>That trip alone may leave little time to also take in the Tunnel View Overlook, where the vista includes several oft-photographed peaks such as Half Dome and El Capitan. The latter alone can take days to climb and require sleeping in slings hung from its cliff faces.</p>
<p>While it can be downright hot in the valley in June, the snow still may not have receded to allow the opening of Glacier Point and Tioga roads into a magical alpine world with few people go.</p>
<p>Hiking cables to Half Dome are typically in place by late May, although lingering snow may hamper the ascent so early in the climbing season. Keep in mind, crossing streams when the water is high is dangerous, too. If you’re determined to backpack this time of year, consider the Hetch Hetchy area along the Toullumne River in the northwest.</p>
<p><strong>Great Smoky Mountains</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/yvsveiukt4ruedgyf1qj.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>The sky on fire above the Great Smoky Mountains. <small><a href=""http://www.stewart-photography.com%20/"">Kevin Stewart</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>There’s no denying that the Great Smoky Mountains, in western NC and eastern TN, is the busiest national park in the U.S. With some 9 million visitors a year, the Smokies attract twice the number than any other.</p>
<p>Few of the 60,000 people who enter the 800-square-miles of mountainous and forested park on a summer weekend day ever leave their cars or the Newfound Gap Road that links the visitor centers of Sugarlands, near Gatlinburg, TN, and Oconaluftee, near Cherokee, NC. All that car exhaust affects visibility, not to mention the overall health of this international biosphere reserve. But the concentrated visitation happily leaves uncongested most of the 880 miles of hiking trails.</p>
<p>That means in June you can luxuriate in the rhododendron, mountain laurel and wild flame azalea bringing vibrant colors to otherwise unbroken expanses of deciduous old growth forest.</p>
<p>If you only have a day for the park, plan to reach the top of lookout tower at the top of Clingmans Dome, the highest point, by sunrise. The payoff is a 360-degree view from the heart of the Smokies. Then head to the western edge of the park and bike the 11-mile Cades Cove Loop Road, which is closed to motor vehicle traffic from May to late September, and spend a couple seconds feeling sorry for all the poor car-bound people a few peaks away.</p>
<p>Stay longer to climb Mont LeConte—which, at 6,593 feet, is the park’s third highest peak. The shortest and steepest way to the top is via the Alum Cave Trail. Make sure to keep a tight grip on the cable that crosses a sheer cliff face at one point. From there you can also tackle the Chimney Tops Trail, another doozy with 1,300 feet of climbing over just two miles. On a day of hiking like this, you’ll pass through Arch Rock en route to the treeless but wildflower covered Inspiration Point.</p>
<p><strong>Glacier National Park</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/zxhreocoqnfm2prurjuo.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Glacier National Park. <small>Sara Schroeder</small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>Another national park primarily experienced by visitors from inside their cars on a spectacularly scenic highway is Montana’s Glacier National Park. But again, to get up close and personal with any of the mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, or 650-plus lakes within the park, one needs to leave their vehicle behind and hoof it on the 700 miles of hiking trails.</p>
<p>The Continental Divide splits Glacier from north to south. The forested trails to the west start at an elevation of 3,200 feet and are less traveled. The eastern trails, at 5,000 feet, attract crowds because of the wide-open vistas.</p>
<p>The exact timing of your visit will be key if you hope to find particular trails open, however. Park service personnel advise that trails at lower elevations and at the edges of the park tend to be free of snow well before the trails in the center of the park and near the Continental Divide. Some trails higher up stay snow covered until late July.</p>
<p>It’s best to call ahead to find out if the main highway, the Going-to-the-Sun Road, is open by late spring. While plowing the road can take up to three months, all 50 miles of it is usually open by mid-June and impassable again in mid-September.</p>
<p>The Apgar Campground on the west side and the St. Mary Campground to the east are open year round, but there is no running water or flush toilets at either much of the year. The water isn’t turned on at Apgar until early May. Car camping sites tend not to open for the summer before July 1.</p>
<p>Because the persistent snow makes spring camping and hiking so challenging, the park requires overnight visitors to obtain backcountry camping permits and fill out itinerary forms in the event that they are reported missing and a search and rescue effort is required.</p>
<p>The park is home to grizzly bears, elk, and bighorn sheep. With luck you’ll avoid the former and catch glimpses of the latter two. You should be spared having to deal with mosquitoes and biting flies, as they tend not to be a nuisance outside July and August.</p>
<p><strong>Shenandoah National Park</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/ytzyxrsqo2lwq7ag0kpu.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Shenandoah waterfall. <small><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/65047661@N00/9816670373/in/photolist-fXt16t-7fvcxE-8zU1Yb-fWGLBe-7AebWS-fWQBdY-fswsuv-zCfgGS-hnH8n2-7ds8D1-7ds8t9-7dofWR-7ds9as-7ds8NC-7ds9dC-dLLSUy-7dofKc-7dogfv-7dofNZ-7ds95f-7ds8Qq-cCH2Uo-cCH3Bq-cCGB7L-cCHhMb-cCHvkE-cCHjoL-cCGNEC-cCHizN-cCGCc3-cCGKjf-cCGM7N-cCHrA7-cCHtzN-cCGDgy-cCHt1J-cCGDZy-cCHs7b-cCroQq-da1Q6M-g3roVv-fhRNSR-cCGMDj-AocS51-7hd7oN-cCHA2o-cCHAVq-cCHxyd-7dofTR-7dog7K"">Jim Lukach</a></small></sub></sup></p>

<p>Shenandoah National Park is a long, narrow strip of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. The crest can be driven or hiked for 100 miles, as Skyline Drive runs parallel to the Appalachian Trail. A few more hundred miles of hiking and horse trails can be followed to even better appreciate the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>The most popular—and dangerous—hike is to the top of Old Rag Mountain. No view is worth significant injury, the park website suggests, so hikers are urged to take precautions: give yourself at least seven hours to complete the nine-mile circuit, carry at least two quarts of water, but otherwise pack light for the rocky scramble.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult climb, yet many people do it, especially on weekends, resulting in long waits at the approaches to the most narrow passages. Go early on a week day to ensure you find a parking spot near the trail head. Campsites are limited. If you go, make sure to thank in advance any search and rescue personnel and Old Rag Mountain Stewards you encounter. You may need them later.</p>
<p>The park service suggests other hikes of varying difficulty, too.</p>
<p>Pull off of Skyline at any of the several overlooks and consider yourself lucky to be enjoying the magnificent views so clearly. As summer wears on, a haze settles over the horizon—caused by the interaction of dust, organic matter and water vapor—giving the Blue Ride its namesake blue. The romance of that natural phenomenon dulls, though, as the blue darkens with the accumulation of industrial smog and vehicle exhaust adding to the mix.</p>
<p>Even in June, the Shenandoah mountaintop can be 10 to 15 degrees cooler than in the towns below. And while the days are warm, you’ll want to put on an extra layer or two at night.</p>
<p><strong>Great Sand Dunes National Park &amp; Preserve</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/ius6ddrrznzozwvcdhfx.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>The beautiful dunes. <small><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/prabalghoshphotography/8572924866"">Prabel Ghoush</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>The Great Sand Dunes are constantly shifting over 30 square miles between the San Juan Mountains and the Sangre de Cristos in southern Colorado. Forty mile per hour winds can pile the sand as high as 750 feet. Medano Creek, which meanders along the edge of the dunes, helps sustain the moisture content in the sand that makes this place so unique.</p>
<p>As tempting as it might be, the Great Sand Dunes are not where you want to be without shoes—or sunscreen or water. The temperature of the sand can reach 150 degrees on sunny summer afternoons. Despite that fact, that’s when the park is most crowded. The dunes are best hiked in the either early or late in the day. That when the photos are best taken, too, as the sun casts dramatic shadows across the undulating sand. Moonlit hikes are eerie but peaceful. But bundle up before you go, as it get down into the 40s.</p>
<p>If you want to hike during the day, when the air temp is 75 to 80 degrees on average in June, you can head up into the foothills of the Sange de Cristos. The minimal shade of juniper and pinyon pine makes way for aspen and cottonwood, and further still, spruce and fir trees. It’s an alpine tundra landscape on the summits, so the groundcover is never lush.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are a couple short trails that can lead you into mule deer and coyote country. What life does thrive here does so above and beyond the dunes. That means there’s no need to worry about stepping on scorpions or snakes in the sand itself.</p>
<p>Ranger-led walks and programs are only available in the summer. Check at the visitor center for a schedule of activities.</p>
<p><strong>Isle Royale National Park</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/rootsrated/image/upload/t_rr_large_traditional/lkfgdn0tqwypi0p5q0wb.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Isle Royale. <small><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IsleRoyaleLakesideCamp.jpg"">Todd VerBeek</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>Local tourism officials like to point out that visitors to Isle Royale in northern Lake Superior stay an average of 3.5 days, while the average visit to other national parks is just four hours. That makes sense when you realize it takes several hours to get there by ferry, which make only so many trips, from the mainland of Minnesota or Michigan. The fact remains, fewer people visit the 45-mile-long island in a year than go to Yellowstone every day.</p>
<p>It’s as fascinating a place as it is remote. Isle Royale is perhaps better known for the interplay between its wolf and moose populations; the focus of study by animal researchers since the late 1950s. The United Nations designated Isle Royale an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.</p>
<p>When you’ve had your fill of hiking and kayaking, you can scuba dive to one of the many shipwrecks around the perimeter of the island.</p>
<p>Isle Royale is worth the trouble to get to, but the place is not for the meek. June and July is a good time to go for many reasons, but it’s also when the mosquitoes, black flies, and gnats swarm and bite most annoyingly.</p>
<p>“If you can’t stand bugs, you will want to arrive mid-August to early September. If you are crazy about wildflowers, mid-June to early July is the best time. Fisherman prefer June, and many backpackers arrive mid- to late September to catch the fall colors or rutting season of the moose,” writes Jim DuFresne in his guidebook <em>Isle Royale National Park Foot Trails and Water Routes</em>.</p>
<p>No matter the time of year, the water there must be boiled for at least two minutes to kill tapeworm cysts. And while the Isle Royale is closed to visitors November to mid-April, campsites can’t be reserved when it is open, so cross-country trekkers just have to hope they can find an unoccupied one by nightfall.</p>
<p>Lake Superior has a cooling effect on the island, generally keeping the day-time temps from exceeding 70 degrees before mid-August. The nights can be in the 40s, though. Thunderstorms and fog are common in the spring and early summer, so it's recommended to have a weather radio handy and tuned in to NOAA broadcasts out of Houghton, MI, or Thunder Bay, ON.</p>
<p>A less remote and arguably even more scenic alternative on Lake Superior is the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore off the tip of Wisconsin’s Bayfield Peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>Voyageurs National Park</strong></p>

</figure>
<p>Voyageurs National Park along the Minnesota-Canadian border is dwarfed by and less well known among Midwest canoe-campers than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota or Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada. Nevertheless, Voyageurs offers a similar landscape with its 300 islands on 30 lakes—the four largest of which are Rainy, Kabetogama, Namakan and Sand Point—all linked by narrow waterways and portage paths.</p>
<p>A key difference is that motorboats can access the 55-mile long park, whereas the adjacent Boundary Waters can only by plied by kayaks and canoes. The distinction means little to the loons, nesting bald eagles, moose, and wolves that find sanctuary throughout the region, or the walleye, northerns, and smallmouth bass that are sought by countless anglers. All that water is a breeding ground for bugs, too. Mosquitoes and black flies are the worst there in early summer.</p>
<p>Except in the winter when ice roads open up, the national park is only accessible by water. Canoes, kayaks, houseboats, motorboats and guides are available for hire in the several small resort towns just outside the park. There are three short hiking trails near the Ash River Visitor Center, where you can also inquire about boat tours with park naturalists.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Recovery is one of the essential parts of training. It's also one of the most overlooked. Whether gearing up to run your next marathon or work out at the gym a few times a week, you want to recover like an athlete for total body wellness and fitness.</p>
<p>You don't have to be training for a once-in-a-lifetime event to learn from and apply the training and recovery techniques elite athletes use. For starters, they understand that training and recovery are a package deal. They also know that skipping recovery won't just limit your results; it will increase your risk of injury.</p>
<p>We want you to love your fitness routine. With that in mind, here are five ways to recover from every workout and training session like a high-caliber athlete.</p>
</div>
<h2>Get in Some Stretching</h2>
<div>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching#:~:text=Stretching%20keeps%20the%20muscles%20flexible,to%20extend%20all%20the%20way."">Harvard Health</a>, stretching is essential for maximizing your workouts and ensuring muscle recovery, and for total body wellness. And it's not just something elite runners or gymnasts do.</p>
<p>""A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. It should be daily,"" says <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching"">David Nolan, a physical therapist</a> at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. When you stretch regularly, you keep your muscles flexible so you can stay limber and mobile. Plus, you help the muscles handle exercise better so that exertion ""won't put too much force on the muscle itself,"" Nolan adds.</p>
</div>
<h2>Cool Down</h2>
<div>
<p>The cool-down period after a workout does more than bring your body temperature back to normal, especially if you're running or performing aerobic activity under higher temperatures or humid conditions. It also allows for your heart rate, circulation, and blood pressure to stabilize back to your normal resting state. Many athletes swear by an ice bath after a training session, but a cold shower or swim also works well.</p>
<p>Taking a few minutes to stretch and breathe are also important factors in the cool-down process after a training session.</p>
</div>
<h2>Take a Break to Recover</h2>
<div>
<p>What you don't do while you're training can be just as important as what you do. Although it may sound counterintuitive, taking breaks and critical recovery days minimizes your risk of exhaustion, burnout and injuries during training. And as any elite athlete will tell you, rest days are as important as the time you spend in the gym.</p>
<p>To keep your body balanced, try a blend of cross-training and alternating between low/moderate and high-intensity training. What does this mean? Slip in a day or two of yoga or meditation in between your weekly cardio and weight training.</p>
<p>But even with these lower-impact days, you still need to take an entire day off every seven to ten days to give your muscles and joints time to recover and reap the benefits of all your hard work. If you push yourself too hard, you might set yourself back later on.</p>
</div>
<h2>Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate</h2>
<div>
<p>Water is the primary way to hydrate before, during, and after a workout. You also need to replenish your electrolytes depending on the intensity and duration of your workout or training session. If you're not necessarily a fan of sports drinks (which can be high in sugar), there are other options to help you hydrate and replenish your electrolytes and carbohydrates:</p>
<p>• Chocolate milk</p>
<p>• Coconut water</p>
<p>• Cherry juice</p>
<p>• Black or green tea (high in antioxidants)</p>
<p>If you really want to treat yourself, get your electrolyte and carb fix with a post-run or workout beer (yes, really). As with most things, be sure to practice moderation.</p>
</div>
<h2>Refuel</h2>
<div>
<p>Unless you're training for multi-sport or ultra endurance event, you probably don't need to consume the same amount of calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates as someone like Michael Phelps or Simone Biles. But refueling your body with a well-balanced diet before and after workouts is the key to long-term training.</p>
<p>If possible, consult with a nutritionist, physician, or personal trainer to design the plan that works best for you — on your training days and your rest days.</p>

</div>
<div><hr></div>
<div>
<p>My feet have carried me from Georgia to Maine in a single excursion, and I have more appreciation for them ever before.</p>
<p>I had taken my feet for granted, until I started thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) and ended up secluded and confined to the walls of a hotel in Franklin, North Carolina for four days. My raw pinky toe had been rubbing against my poorly fitting boot, changing my gait and causing me unbearable pain. Not only that, my ankles began to swell up with fluid.</p>
<p>I knew I had to listen to my body. Something was wrong and I had to address it.</p>
<p>Once I did, I realized the importance of taking care of my feet. Although there is no magical combination of hiking shoe/boot and sock combination that works for every person, it's important to <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"" title=""Try our insole finder quiz"">find the right combination that works well for you</a>. Outside of that, I have taken things I learned from the experience of thru-hiking, speaking with a foot professional at my local outdoor store, and from trial and error to help my feet feel their best.<br><br>Here are my top tips for keeping your feet feeling great while hiking.</p>
</div>
<h2>Elevate your legs and feet</h2>
<div>
<p>This is a huge one, especially for those who walk around with what seems like water sloshing around in your ankles. Studies show that elevating your legs and feet reduces swelling by using gravity to your advantage. Fight the gravity, don't let it keep your legs and feet down! The rewards also include better blood circulation and relief from muscle tension. I had issues doing this on trail but found it easier to do it at night at camp when I laid down. I’d gather any extra gear and prop my feet up.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Cold Water Therapy</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rivers, creeks and ponds (without leeches!) are a hiker's best friend. At every water source I found, I would hydrate and let my tender feet soak. Water is the center of life — we need it to sustain our bodies, including our feet. Swollen and weary feet deserve some time at nature’s spa. Soak your feet as much as you can in the coldest water you can find. Natural and clean sources — meaning clear water, not water that looks like chocolate milk — is best. Just five minutes can make a difference. The refreshing frigid water will literally shock your feet back to life.</p>
</div>
<h2>Massage or Roll-Out Your Feet</h2>
<div>
<p>Cork balls and hands are great tools for helping your feet wind down after a long day of hiking. As a beginning hiker, I never knew about the wonders of rolling out the bottom of my foot with a cork ball but now, we've become inseparable. On the trail, I developed <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" title=""Plantar Fasciitis Explained"">plantar fasciitis</a> and I had two choices. One: grin and bear it by neglecting my feet. Or, a much better choice: roll out and massage my feet every day. At first it was a nuisance but then I got into a routine of rolling my feet for at least two minutes on each foot. Thirty seconds does the job but I liked to really work my sore tendons out. It helps tremendously with foot pain and inflammation.</p>
</div>
<h2>Take Breaks</h2>
<div>
<p>I have always been a huge advocate of taking days off from a thru-hike to let my feet heal. I always double-zero on the AT because I knew one day would not be sufficient for my feet. On those days, especially if I am at a hostel, I will take a sitz foot bath, then ice my feet while staying off of them as much as possible. Taking breaks also applies to the days I am hiking. It is so easy to get into a habit of wanting to be efficient and doing big miles but just remember that when you take a loan from the bank, you have to pay it back. I usually take three breaks a day, pull off my shoes and socks and sit for about twenty minutes. The constant contact of foot to ground takes its toll and breaks are always appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Feet are critical to hiking and demand our respect and tenderness. The key to preventing foot injuries is to make them a priority in the first place. Knowing how to take care of them before a hike can make the difference between a lovely trip or a miserable one that costs you pain, suffering or even worse — your whole hike. Before I thru-hiked the AT, I did copious amounts of research on gear, weather and resupply but didn't learn about how to take care of my feet. <br><br>I learned the hard way and turned my pain into power. Everyday I embrace my feet and I thank them for carrying me. Whether it's to the grocery store or across the country, my feet deserve it, and so do yours.</p>

<p><em>Written By: Paul Langer, DPM — Superfeet Wellness Panel Member. Paul Langer is a sports medicine podiatrist who treats athletes of all abilities at Twin Cities Orthopedics in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is the author of Great Feet For Life and lectures internationally on the topics of lower extremity health and footwear.</em></p>
<p>Non-traumatic knee pain is one of the most common sports injuries seen in sports medicine clinics, accounting for 25-40% of all knee injuries.*<br><br>The medical literature refers to this type of pain as patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). PFPS is different from acute knee injuries like Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) ruptures in that it is an overuse injury with a gradual onset of pain.</p>
<p><br>PFPS causes pain to the front of the knee with weight bearing activity. It is more common in women than men and more common in activities that repetitively load and bend the knee, like running, which is why this condition is often called Runner’s Knee.</p>
<p>Pain with activities such as stair climbing and pain after arising from a seated position can be symptoms of PFPS. PFPS can be a chronic and recurrent condition for some people even after being treated clinically and like some other overuse conditions, there has been a lack of evidence-based guidelines for treatment.</p>
<h2>Recommended Treatments for Runner’s Knee</h2>
<p>To address the lack of official guidelines for treatment, a panel of researchers and clinicians was convened to develop consensus-based recommendations. The panel evaluated the highest quality research and expert opinion of researchers and clinicians who specialize in PFPS. They reviewed research papers on treatments like exercises, in-shoe orthotic devices (“foot orthoses”), taping and bracing and adjunctive therapies like acupuncture and combination therapies.</p>
<p>The panel looked at how those treatments reduced pain and improved function, and they further stratified treatments for short, medium and long term aspects of treatment.</p>
<p>The paper, <em>2016 Patellofemoral pain consensus statement from the 4th International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreat</em>, was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.**</p>
<p>The expert panel came up with six recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise-therapy is recommended to reduce pain in the short, medium and long term, and improve function in the medium and long term.</li>
<li>Combining hip and knee exercises is recommended to reduce pain and improve function in the short, medium and long term, and this combination should be used in preference to knee exercises alone.</li>
<li>Combined interventions are recommended to reduce pain in adults with patellofemoral pain in the short and medium term.</li>
<li>Foot orthoses are recommended to reduce pain in the short term.</li>
<li>Patellofemoral, knee and lumbar mobilizations are not recommended.</li>
<li>Electrophysical agents are not recommended.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will focus on numbers 1-4 since they tell us what we should do (numbers 5 and 6 since they tell us what not to do).</p>
<p>The experts recommend exercises, especially those that target the hips and knees for short, medium and long term for both pain and function. <br><br>They also recommended a combination of treatments that also include patient education and taping for short and medium term to reduce pain. This is valuable information because it tells us no matter what time interval a patient is at in their injury recovery period, exercises are important. Combination therapies after the medium term however are less likely to be of help. All exercise programs should be under the guidance of a medical professional. <br><br>In-shoe orthotic devices were recommended for pain reduction in the short term. This can be interpreted to mean that as treatment starts, using insoles can be useful to reduce knee pain so that the injured person can remain somewhat active and/or by reducing using insoles to reduce knee pain may be able to progress through early therapy and exercise programs with less limitation. <br><br>After the short term however, insoles were of less use in the therapy program. It is important to understand that the in-shoe devices recommended were not custom-made foot orthoses but were prefabricated devices that could be modified to optimize comfort. Which means that it would be reasonable for someone with PFPS to fit an insole in a retail setting by trying on the insoles and then selecting the most comfortable one. A skilled medical professional then could modify the device as needed in clinic if necessary.<br><br>Future research in this area will shed light on subgroups of those with PFPS and help better tailor treatment. For example, accumulating data may start to reveal patterns regarding age, sex and biomechanical differences that help us understand how to prioritize treatments or who is more likely to respond to certain treatment options. <br><br>For now, it is important for anyone who has knee pain that limits their activity to seek treatment and then start a therapy program under the guidance of a medical professional according to these guidelines.</p>

Thanks to state-of-the-art comprehensive assessment tools in hundreds of running and sporting goods stores, your biometric data can be analyzed and used to craft premium insoles perfectly attuned to not just the shape of your feet but the way your feet move as well.</p>
<p>These incredible data insights set ME3D personalized insoles apart from most custom insoles made from foam or plaster molds. But the biometric data that goes into each pair of ME3Ds is only half the story.</p>
<p>The meticulous 3D-printing and hand-assembly process is equally cutting-edge and fascinating. Let’s take a look at how premium ME3D personalized insoles are made to order.</p>

<div>Are ME3D personalized insoles really all individually 3D-printed?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In short, yes. The data from your in-store scans is translated into the cap of the insole, which forms the support structure around the heel and under the arch. Your 3D foot scan provides measurements like foot size and arch height while the pressure plate records where each foot experiences the most and least amounts of pressure through the entire gait cycle—from the moment your heel hits the ground to the second your toes lift off.</p>
<p>The way each area of the foot experiences pressure effects five independent support zones built into the ME3D cap that can be individually tuned to be flexible, firm, or somewhere in between. The timing and distribution of forces during each step determine the angle (ranging from -30° to 30°) of directional flex lines seen on the bottom of the cap. These flex lines help guide your foot during the gait cycle.</p>
<p>But enough about the data, let’s get into the printing. Superfeet uses multiple industrial 3D printers at our production facility in Washington state to print the personalized cap for each individual ME3D insole. They always come in pairs, but the right and left insole caps from the same order can differ slightly in flex lines and support zones because right and left feet belonging to the same person can be slightly different sizes or have subtly different movement patterns.</p>
<p>The 3D printers, each about the size of a small car, use a polyamide powder mixed with fluid detailing and fusing agents to build the caps one fraction-of-a-millimeter layer at a time. The printers can build 140 caps in each batch. The curves of the caps, standing on their side edge instead of flat, can be seen forming slowly yet meticulously over 12 to 16 hours.</p>
<p>Once the batch is done, like a giant ink cartridge getting taken out of a normal office printer, the filing-cabinet-sized build unit is wheeled from the 3D printer to a processing station. The excess polyamide powder is vacuumed away revealing the ME3D caps. The powder is recycled and combined with new powder for another build.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>How does a 3D-printed cap get turned into a finished insole?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Once the caps have been cleaned, they are ready to be glued to high quality energizing foam to form the perfect cushioned yet supportive insole. Because each cap is unique, they are checked and organized by hand to make sure the correct left and right pairs go together. You can customize your ME3Ds with your name on the back of each insole, so it’s important insoles with the same name stay together!</p>
<p>Each personalized insole cap is glued by hand to the premium foam layer and vacuum-formed together for a lasting seal. The caps are then double checked to make sure they are the correct pair and placed into the corresponding box—which also has your name on it.</p>
<p>The ME3D production process combines the precision of the latest 3D-printing technology with the quality assurance that comes with assembling products by hand. Our facility in Washington state turns raw powder and foam pieces into premium products that help people move through the world and enjoy life on their feet.</p>

<p>A heel spur is a common and often painful foot condition that anyone can develop, but it most often afflicts athletes who run and jump frequently. As a result, track athletes and amateur runners may suffer from these calcium build-ups on their heel. Dealing with bone spurs requires accurate diagnosis and a common-sense course of treatment. Without help, you may find your activity severely limited.</p>
</div>
<h2>What are heel spurs?</h2>
<div>
<p>A heel spur is a calcium deposit that can cause a boney protrusion on the underside of the foot, most often on the heel bone (calcaneus). A heel spur is typically not visible but can be diagnosed via an x-ray of the foot.</p>
</div>
<h2>Heel spur causes</h2>
<p>Heel spurs are most often caused by repetitive running or jumping on hard surfaces.</p>
<div>
<p>If you suffer from plantar fasciitis, a condition affecting the plantar fascia between your heel and your toes, you are more likely to suffer from bone spurs as well. Increasing age, diabetes, flat feet and regular long periods of standing can also cause you to develop these spurs. Anything that consistently places strain on your heel can cause these calcium deposits to develop.</p>
</div>
<h2>Heel spur symptoms</h2>
<div>
<p>Although heel spurs may be up to 1/2 inch long, curving from under your heel toward your arch, some are painless. You can have one and never know it. However, 50% of those with heel spurs do notice a number of symptoms, like:<br><br>• Pain<br>• Swelling<br>• Inflammation<br>• Feeling of Warmth<br>• Tenderness<br><br>Heel spurs are difficult to diagnose unless your doctor performs some imaging on your foot. The symptoms of a bone spur are quite similar to other podiatric conditions. Usually, an X-ray will identify the bone spur and allow your physician to develop an effective treatment plan.</p>
</div>
<h2>Heel spur treatment</h2>
<div>
<p>Doctors seldom operate on heel spurs anymore, although it was once a fairly common practice. Now doctors focus on non-surgical interventions such as stretching exercises, physical therapy, specially designed shoes and custom heel spur insoles. For those more difficult cases, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and the resulting pain. OTC pain relievers such as ibuprofen are also frequently helpful in reducing the symptoms of heel spurs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, rest is not effective for this condition. In fact, you may experience more pain after a night's sleep than you did during the previous day's activities simply because the plantar fascia is particularly sensitive until it stretches once more.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet help for heel spurs</h2>
<div>
<p>Prevention of the development of a heel spur starts by wearing supportive and properly fitting footwear for your activities. Once you've received a diagnosis, adding the orthotic support of Superfeet shape to your footwear can help provide heel spur pain relief and keep your feet as comfortable as possible.</p>

<div>
<p>If you struggle with foot pain, fatigue after a long day on your feet, or you’re looking to advance athletic performance with more efficient strides, you’ve come to the right place. There are many different Superfeet insoles to choose from, each with their own unique materials and characteristics based on the intended use.</p>
<p>One of the most common considerations when thinking about insoles is how soft or firm they should feel, especially when it comes to relieving pain. Soft, squishy materials don’t actually provide the best relief in the long run. The right shape under your feet, and materials durable enough to keep that shape step after step, can offer a long-lasting solution. That’s why even the softest Superfeet give structured yet flexible support to the arches and heels. Read on to find out the benefits of soft vs. firm insoles and the best way to figure out what would feel best to you.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of soft vs. firm insoles?</h2>
<p>Superfeet insoles are not only designed for specific footwear and activities, they also come in a variety of cushion options from soft to firm. Here are the benefits of each and why you may want to choose one over the other.</p>
<p>Insoles on the firmer side of the spectrum deliver long-lasting, structured support. They are very beneficial for people who want stabilizing shape under their feet. Softer Superfeet provide shape and support that flexes with the foot, offering a cushioned experience designed to seamlessly integrate into athletic shoes or add anti-fatigue cushioning to work footwear.</p>
<p>Deciding between soft and firm insoles can depend on the intended use as well. Many people wear both, firm insoles in their everyday shoes that see the most use and cushioned, flexible insoles in their running shoes, for example.</p>
<h2>Are soft or firm insoles better for pain relief?</h2>
<p>When many people think of insoles, they only picture squishy, gel shoe inserts, especially if they are experiencing pain. Stepping on hard surfaces causes discomfort, so it’s understandable to think that stepping on something soft would ease that discomfort. However, the problem usually lies not just with hard surfaces, but flat surfaces under the feet as well.</p>
<p>Even people with very low arches don’t have completely flat feet. Soreness and pain can stem from inflammation that occurs when the tissue in your foot becomes strained trying to adapt to the flat, unforgiving surface inside your shoe. Providing the right contoured shape underfoot gives your arch and heel proper support, helping to prevent stretching or tearing that can lead to discomfort. Squishy, shapeless inserts may absorb some impact but don’t provide any of the shape needed for true, long-term relief.</p>
<p>That is why many people experiencing pain prefer firm insoles like Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"">All-Purpose Support High Arch</a> (also available in <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"">Medium Arch</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"">Low Arch</a>). The stable support offers durable shape anatomically designed to optimize foot comfort, matching the contour of the arch and keeping soft tissue contained under the heel bone to absorb impact. That said, the patented Adaptive Comfort Technology™ in Superfeet insoles like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-medium-arch"">Run Cushion Medium Arch</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"">Work Cushion</a> enables flexibility and structure to work together to provide a softer feel that still gives underfoot support.</p>
<p>Whether you choose Support or Cushion insoles, Superfeet can help relieve pain and have you feeling your best.</p>
<h2>What makes a Superfeet insole soft or firm?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the many different types of Superfeet insoles, it is important to note that “soft” in regards to Superfeet doesn’t mean “squishy” and “firm” doesn’t mean “rigid.” The softest Superfeet still have supportive shape and the firmest insoles include a foam layer that helps absorb impact.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of soft Superfeet insoles are a premium foam layer, sometimes two layers for extra cushion, and flexible rearfoot support that moves with the foot thanks to our patented Adaptive Comfort Technology. The softest Superfeet are any insoles with the word “Cushion” in the name, like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-high-arch"">Run Cushion High Arch</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"">Work Slim-Fit Cushion</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"">Hike Cushion</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the most recognizable Superfeet products are on the firm side of the spectrum. All-Purpose Support insoles, previously known by color names like GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK, provide incredibly reliable support thanks to the durable stabilizer cap under the rearfoot and a high-density foam layer that supports the foot from heel to toe.</p>
<p>If you feel caught between wanting a cushioned feel and needing firm shape, insoles like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"">Hike Support</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"">All-Purpose High Impact Support</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-memory-foam-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-memory-foam-support"">All-Purpose Memory Foam Support</a> offer both premium cushioning and robust rearfoot support.</p>
<h2>Soft, Firm, or In-Between: The Perfect Superfeet For You</h2>
<p>When taking steps to find the right insoles, all paths lead back to your personal comfort. If you know you like to feel structured support under your arches, go for firmer insoles. If cushioned support that flexes with your foot as it moves is more appealing to you, check out all the great Superfeet Cushion options. If you want something in between, there are plenty of semi-firm insoles that provide both structured support and premium foam cushioning.</p>

<p>Hammer toes are named for the shape your toes take when the muscles are out of balance. Your toes can curl and even lock into a hammer shape. Imagine curling your toes and having them stay in that position. Your mobility would be limited, and you'd experience frequent if not constant pain. Those who have this condition suffer from a number of unpleasant symptoms. Below we'll break down the symptoms, causes and treatment for Hammer Toe, and let you know how Superfeet can help.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is a hammer toe?</h2>
<div>
<p>Hammer toes are toes permanently curled into a hammer shape due to weakened toe muscles. Your toe tendons shorten, pulling your toes into an unnatural and uncomfortable position. You can have two different types of hammer toes: flexible and rigid. Flexible hammer toes still have movable joints. Rigid hammer toes are immovable and often require surgery.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of hammer toe</h2>
<div>
<p>In addition to curled toes, the symptoms of hammer toe include pain in the problem toes when you flex them, or when you wear certain shoes. The toes may swell, develop callouses, burn and turn red. Sores may appear on the afflicted toes, inviting infection. For patients with diabetes, these sores can become dangerous due to decreased circulation.</p>
</div>

<h2>Treatment for hammer toe</h2>
<div>
<p>You will have a better outcome if you seek treatment for hammer toe while the joint is still movable. At that point, stretching and exercising the toes may help prevent the condition from worsening. For instance, you may find picking up marbles with your toes help keep them flexible. In addition to prescribing corn pads and foot straps, your doctor may order a cortisone injection to treat severe toe pain. If the toes cannot be moved, you may require hammer toe surgery to put the toe and tendons back in position and to remove deformed bone.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet help for hammer toe</h2>
<div>
<p>Wear shoes that have low heels and a roomy toe box if you have hammer toe — your toes should have ample room to move within your footwear. Look for shoes with built-in support or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">use over-the-counter insoles, like Superfeet</a>, in all your footwear. The supportive, orthotic shape of Superfeet insoles cradles and stabilizes your feet inside your shoes, reducing the need to ""grip"" with your toes and minimizing some of the pain cause by this condition.</p>

"589638369463","5-rarely-traveled-day-hikes-in-olympic-national-park","MERGE","5 Rarely-Traveled Day Hikes in Olympic National Park","Superfeet","<p>We are quickly becoming a nation of nature addicts. Each summer, millions flock to wilderness regions around the country in hopes of scoring some secluded time in the midst of gorgeous natural settings. All too often though, we hope to find a slice of silence and solitude in our national parks, only to discover the trail we were hoping for is full of other people looking for the same thing. Trails are getting tapped out, forcing those of us who are up for more of an adventure to seek out new regions.</p>
<p>Our national parks are popular, as they deserve to be. The trails near their paved parking lots are crowded, as they should be. But there are always ways to dive deeper into the backcountry; to discover lesser-known paths in relatively untouched corners of the parks.</p>
<p>Olympic National Park, for instance, offers hundreds of these corners throughout its 611 miles of trails, making it the ideal place to reconnect with true wilderness and find that increasingly elusive solitude. Here are 5 of the least-traveled trails in Olympic National Park for you to discover.</p>
<h2>1. South Fork of the Hoh</h2>
<p>While everyone else is hiking the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/seattle-wa/backpacking-camping/hoh-river-trail-backpacking-camping"">Hoh River Trail</a> and Hall of Mosses, the South Fork of the Hoh quietly waits to be discovered. Remote, rarely visited, and granting access to ancient forests and huge sitka spruces, the stroll next to the South Fork of the Hoh is breathtaking. This trail doesn’t posses the magnitude of mosses that drip along the trees near the main trails of the Hoh. Instead, the forest becomes a jungle, with sections of the trail seemingly separated by walls of nurse logs, moss, and huge timber. The forest floor is ridiculously green and lush, impossibly so in the late spring and early summer months. After 3.5 miles of pristine wilderness and solitude, the trail ends along the banks of the majestic Hoh River. Giving off a stunning view in the middle of this immense slice of solitude, the world feels wild, rugged, and perfect.</p>
<h2>2. The Duckabush</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>Entering Olympic National Park along the Duckabush River<small> Douglas Scott</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Chances are, you've never heard of the Duckabush River. This stunningly steep and beautiful river on the eastern flank of the Olympic Mountains is short and sweet, offering a few majestic views and remote old-growth timber. Most who hike the Duckabush won’t actually enter the national park, as the boundary is located 6.8 miles up trail. It won’t matter though, the hike starts out in Olympic National Forest before quickly crossing into The Brothers Wilderness, a 16,000+ acre swath of secluded, protected land. The highlight of day hiking along the Duckabush is the trail up to Big Hump, though all should hike to the national park boundary just a little over a mile away. At Big Hump, stunning views of the Duckabush River Valley erupt in both directions, while The Brothers Mountains loom high above.</p>
<h2>3. Upper Lena Lake</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>The view of Mount Bretherton from Upper Lena Lake<small> Douglas Scott</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you have hiked along the Hood Canal side of the Olympic Peninsula, you have either heard of or hiked <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/5-amazing-high-alpine-lakes-to-explore-in-olympic-national-park"">Lena Lake</a> . The popular Lena Lake Trail rests in the Olympic National Forest, and makes for a great introduction to the backcountry lakes of the region. While most stop and admire the shimmering beauty, those who want awesome mountain views and even prettier, accessible lakes need to head up a steep ridge and discover the majesty of Upper Lena Lake. Gaining nearly 5,000 feet from the parking lot, 7.3 miles away, Upper Lena Lake is truly one of the more fun hikes in Olympic National Park. The trail is a bit difficult, but the reward is worth every drop of sweat. In the shadow of Mount Bretherton and Mount Lena, Upper Lena Lake is a high alpine gem, bringing to mind a few views reminiscent of Glacier National Park.</p>
<h2>4. Bogachiel</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>The start of the Bogachiel Rainforest.<small> Douglas Scott</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just a few miles from Forks and the jaw-dropping beaches of LaPush, rests one of America’s least known rainforest regions, as it has for thousands of years. The Bogachiel River is crossed by millions each year, as they travel between Forks and the Hoh Rainforest, yet few take the time to discover it. The trailhead to the Bogachiel is up Undie Road, which quickly ends a few miles from Highway 101. At the trailhead, the region doesn’t look too amazing. However, just a few thousand feet from the parking area, magical sections of forest emerge, growing evermore impressive the closer you get to the Olympic National Park boundary. Once inside the park, the beauty of the Bogachiel becomes readily apparent, as massive old-growth timber rises out of the fern-filled forest floor. Hiking the trail is like traveling back in time to a prehistoric land. Ideally, this trail should be hiked as an 11.6 mile out-and-back.</p>
<h2>5. Deer Park</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>The trail from Deer Park to Maiden Peak and Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park<small> Douglas Scott</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The crowds will flock to Hurricane Ridge all summer long, taking in the breathtaking sights atop one of the most scenic ridges in the world. While you should never skip Hurricane Ridge, those who have already seen the sites and hiked the hikes need to bypass the Ridge and head up to Blue Mountain and Deer Park. Located east of Hurricane Ridge, the road to Deer Park is not for the faint of heart. Narrow, dirt, and gravel paths—with occasional vanishing shoulders leading to impressive drop-offs—wind their way through a high-alpine paradise unlike anything else in the Pacific Northwest. The road leads nearly to the summit of Blue Mountain, which gives off views of the entire Olympic interior, as well as the Salish Sea, Strait of Juan De Fuca, British Columbia, and the mountains of the North Cascades. For those looking for hiking, park at the lower lot and hike the 12-mile round trip ridge hike to Maiden Peak. You'll likely see more deer, marmots, and mountain goats than you will people.</p>

<div>
<p>We have all experienced tired and aching feet. With the increased demand in labor intensive jobs, and the growing rate of obesity in the US, painful feet are one of the most common reasons patients seek care from a podiatrist. Foot pain, often described as throbbing, achy, pain along the bottom of the feet typically on the arches or radiating from the heel bone, can be extremely debilitating. Some experience pain after wearing ill-fitting shoes (the remedy, of course, is to remove the shoes to relieve the pain). But what about the nagging and generalized achy pain that fails to go away?</p>
<p>The first thing is to determine what could be the possible cause of the nagging pain:</p>
<p><em>Have you had a sudden increase in activities?</em><br><em>Have you experienced weight gain? </em><br><em>Have you placed a lot of stress or strain on your feet recently? (Example: changes you may not think about, like a recent move to a new house where you are walking more than usual in a short period of time, can result in foot pain.)</em></p>
<p>Typically, increased demand and stress on your feet equates to more pain. Identifying the cause can help you identify solutions, and help you prevent foot pain from occurring in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies to help relieve those tired and aching feet and get you back to performing daily activities with ease:</p>
</div>
<h2>Tips to relieve tired
and aching feet: Wear the right shoes</h2>
<div><p>First, make sure you are wearing the right athletic shoes for you. People often wear shoes that are not the proper fit for their feet. Everyone has a unique foot type that requires a specific shoe for optimal support and comfort, and shoes are not one-size-fits-all. Determine your foot type and shoe size by going to a<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/store-locator""> local athletic shoe store</a> to get measured. You might even find that your right foot and left foot are different sizes. </p></div>
<h2>Tips to relieve tired
and aching feet: Consider orthotic insoles

</h2>
<div><p>You might benefit from the comfort and support of an orthotic insert, depending on your foot type and the style of shoe you are wearing. Orthotic inserts are devices used to help provide additional support to someone’s feet that are placed inside shoes.<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles""> Superfeet has a variety of orthotic inserts</a> made to fit different types of shoes. </p></div>
<h2>Tips to relieve tired
and aching feet: Start a stretching routine</h2>
<div><p>Most of the time, the ligaments and tendons in your feet and legs are not stretched often enough, which can result in foot pain. The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body, and frequently it<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/achilles-tendonitis-explained""> is shortened or contracted</a> due to not being adequately stretched.</p></div>

<h2>Tips to relieve tired and aching feet: Bring on
the ice</h2>
<div><p>Icing your feet at the end of the day can help tremendously in reducing inflammation, pain and swelling. You can get a bottle of water and freeze it and then roll it under your feet to help provide relief.</p></div>
<h2>Tips to relieve tired
and aching feet: Epsom salt soak</h2>
<div>
<p>Soak your feet in a mixture of warm water and Epsom salt. Epsom salt soak foot baths have been found to be an effective foot stress reliever. The mixture of magnesium and heat helps increase blood circulation to help improve mobility and relax tense muscle fibers.</p>
<p>I hope you found these tips helpful and that you are able to get back on your feet pain free.</p>

<p>The latest innovation in work comfort and injury prevention is here. Introducing Superfeet <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion"">Work Cushion</a> and <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion-slim-fit"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/work-cushion-slim-fit"">Work Cushion Slim-Fit</a> insoles – two brand-new insoles engineered specifically to provide durable, anti-fatigue support so you can feel good on your feet no matter how long your shift.</p>
<p>Designed for work footwear, with a tapered forefoot for a great fit in safety toe boots, Superfeet Work Cushion and Work Slim-Fit Cushion offer two options for hardworking people in a variety of industries who spend most of their day on their feet. Whether you work in construction, manufacturing, healthcare, or hospitality, sore and achy feet can affect everything you do and even lead to pain in your joints, back and entire body. Having the right cushion and support in your shoes can make a world of difference in helping to prevent or eliminate discomfort, letting you focus on the job, not on the pain.</p>
<p>Workers have worn Superfeet on the job for years, and with the introduction of these two new insoles, Superfeet is offering <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/work"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/work"">more options</a> than ever before to meet the needs of those whose livelihoods depend on their feet.</p>

<p>""Since our founding in 1977, Superfeet has been a secret ally in the boots of workers around the world, who have depended on the essential, uncompromising support that <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/health-wellness/orthotic-superfeet-shape-arch-support-and-so-much-more"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/health-wellness/orthotic-superfeet-shape-arch-support-and-so-much-more"">Superfeet shape</a> can provide to get them through long hours on their feet,” says Matt Gooch, Vice President of Product and Innovation at Superfeet. “However, the launch of the Superfeet Work category and these two new work specific products, Work Cushion and Work Slim-Fit Cushion, signal a marked shift in our strategy. We are no longer willing to let the value of Superfeet shape remain a secret limited to those 'in-the-know', but rather we want workers everywhere to be able to experience the reductions in foot fatigue, pain and discomfort that research has shown and our customers tell us they experience every single day.""</p>

<h2>CUSHION VS. SLIM-FIT CUSHION – WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>""Our two new Work insoles round out a selection of other work-friendly support styles in the Superfeet product line by adding industry leading cushion and light structured, flexible arch support,” according to Matt Gooch. “Featuring our exclusive Adaptive Comfort Technology™ (A.C.T.), the new Work Cushion and Work Slim-Fit Cushion are able to accommodate for all arch types and fit a wide range of different work footwear. Both insoles are safety-toe footwear approved, with a forefoot that tapers under the toes and feature our Moisturewick™ odor-reducing top cover.”</p>
<p>Regarding the difference between the two new styles, he says, “Work Cushion is ideal for workers who spend time on their feet in roomier work footwear and uses cutting-edge super-critical foam to deliver plush, durable cushion to industrial athletes during long shifts. Work Slim-Fit Cushion is ideal for tighter fitting and/or athletic inspired work footwear, delivering fatigue reducing cushion in a thin package.”</p>
<p>In other words, if you’ve got some room in your boots, Work Cushion can replace the flat, unsupportive removable liner that came in them. If you wear shoes at work that look more like running or athletic footwear, Work Slim-Fit Cushion is a great choice, again replacing the factory liner. In addition, Superfeet <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"">All-Purpose Support Low Arch</a> offers stabilizing support thin enough for many shoes without removable liners.</p>

<p>At Superfeet, we believe everyone deserves to feel great on their feet, whether <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">running</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"">hiking</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/work"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/work"">working</a>, or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"">getting the most</a> out of life with the right support in every step. That’s why we offer a wide range of insoles designed specifically for many different types of feet and footwear. From cushioned, flexible comfort to firm, stabilizing support, there’s a pair of Superfeet for you.</p>
<p>We also offer insoles in a variety of arch heights. Read on to find out the best way to match the perfect insole arch height to your feet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What arch height are my feet?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Feet come in all shapes and sizes. Some feet are mostly flat from heel to toe, some have tissue that forms a high arch shape in between the heel and forefoot. Most people fall somewhere in between, and all are considered normal.</p>
<p>As you place your foot on the floor, if most or all of the inside of your foot touches the ground, you likely have lower arches. It can be harder to tell the difference between medium and high arches.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick and easy test (it works the same with or without socks) that can help narrow down what type of arch you have. First, grab a pencil, preferably one with an eraser on the end, then plant your foot on a flat surface. Make sure to put the same amount of weight on your foot as you would if you were standing normally. Next, point the eraser of the pencil at the arch of your foot, and slide the pencil underneath the highest point of your arch.</p>
<p>If the pencil stops at the eraser, you likely have low arches. If most or all of the ferrule (the silver part that holds the eraser) fits underneath your foot, then you likely have medium arches. If you can slide the pencil farther under your foot so that it surpasses the ferrule and more, then you likely have high arches.</p>
<p>This test is meant to be a starting place, particularly if you have never considered the arch height of your feet. It is by no means a scientific comparison, but it does provide a general idea of your arch height in an easy-to-do way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Insole Arch Height: Comfort is Key</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Once you have an approximate idea of how high your arches are, finding support under your feet that feels the most comfortable to you is the most important thing to enjoy the full benefits of Superfeet insoles. People with high arches generally find insoles with a high-arch shape to fit the best, and the same goes for those with medium and low arches.</p>
<p>That said, personal comfort can vary from person to person. Some people with lower arches like the shape that firm, high arch insoles like Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"">All-Purpose Support High Arch</a> give their feet. The best way to think about which insole arch height will work for you is to consider how much support and “presence” you like to feel under your feet. High arch insoles will provide more presence (a “higher dose” of Superfeet shape) than insoles with low arches.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Which insole arch height should I choose?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Keeping your own comfort preferences in mind is most important, but another factor determining which insoles you choose is the type of footwear you will be wearing them in. The geometry of some (but not all) low-arch Superfeet insoles, like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"">Run Support Low Arch</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"">All-Purpose Support Low Arch</a>, makes them thinner, which means they can fit better in tight shoes. An athlete with high arches may wear Run Support Low Arch insoles in certain slim-fitting footwear because having Superfeet shape that fits the best is better than not having that support in every step.</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles at any arch height will usually fit well in most shoes with removable liners. If you are new to wearing Superfeet, or are still unsure of which arch height will be most comfortable for you, try a medium arch insole like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-medium-arch"">Run Cushion Medium Arch</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"">All-Purpose Support Medium Arch</a>. You can always try a pair designed for all arch heights (and made with memory foam cushioning) like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"">Casual Support</a> insoles.</p>
<p>No matter your arch height, cushioning preference or type of footwear, Superfeet insoles can provide that missing puzzle piece of support that perfectly fits in between the contoured shape of your feet and the flat surface inside your shoes.</p>

"589638238391","lacing-patterns-for-common-foot-issues","MERGE","Lacing Patterns for Common Foot Issues","Superfeet","<h3>How you lace up your shoes can make all the difference in comfort and performance.</h3>
<p>We spend a lot of time researching the proper shoes for our sport — whether it be running, CrossFit or strength training — making sure that they fit just so and that they provide optimal support and perform well during activity. But once afoot, your shoes are only good if they are comfortable, and how you lace them up can make or break your workout experience.</p>
<p>How you lace your shoes can make or break your workout experience.</p>
<p>""Common problems with shoe dysfunction during training can often be fixed with simple changes to lacing,"" says Jason Havey, DPM, chief resident of podiatric surgery at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. And while the tightness of a shoe is often a matter of preference, the general rule of thumb, according to Havey, is that a shoe should be ""comfortably snug"": Your foot should not be able to move around, but there also should not be any discomfort.</p>
<p>Here are some common issues you might encounter with your footwear and the lacing techniques to resolve them.</p>
<h6>.<small> Oxygen Magazine/</small>Toe-box relief lacing</h6>
<h3>
<strong>ISSUE: </strong> Black toenails or Morton's toe</h3>
<p>Some runners claim that unless you have black toenails, you're not legit. Truth be told, disgusting, dead nails are not a badge of honor. ""If your shoes are too tight or narrow, your toes will hit the front of the shoe with every step, leading to toenail problems,"" Havey says. Also, people whose second toe is genetically longer than the others — called Morton's toe — can have the same issues with their toes continually striking the front of the toe box. Use this lacing technique to lift the toe box, creating room and preventing the shoe from pressing down on your nails and toes.</p>
<h3>
<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Toe-box relief lacing</h3>
<p>Completely remove the lace from the shoe. Thread one end down through the eyelet on the side nearest your big toe, then bring it diagonally up and across, pulling it up through the top eyelet on the opposite side. Leave enough lace so that you can progressively weave the other end back and forth up to the top of the shoe.</p>
<h6>
<small>Oxygen Magazine / </small>Pressure-relief lacing</h6>
<h3>
<strong>ISSUE: </strong> Hot spots, numbness and/or tingling on top of the foot</h3>
<p>The last thing you want to have happen during a race or workout is to have your feet fall asleep or get a blister where your shoe rubs or presses down on your foot. ""High-arched individuals or those with a high instep are prone to nerve irritation across the top of the foot,"" Havey says. ""The downward pressure of the laces on the bones of the midfoot can irritate the nerves in the area."" Use this technique to relieve this top-heavy pressure and prevent irritation of nerves and/or skin.</p>
<h3>
<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Pressure-relief lacing</h3>
<p>Identify where you're feeling the pressure or where the shoe is rubbing, then unlace the shoe to a point just below that spot. Thread the laces vertically up the sides of the shoe, going as high as needed until you're above the hot spot, then resume your normal diagonal lacing to the top.</p>
<div></div>
<h6>Oxygen Magazine/Narrow-foot lock lacing</h6>
<h3>
<strong>ISSUE: </strong> Shoes too loose/narrow feet</h3>
<p>Just as it is difficult for those with wide feet to find a comfortably fitting shoe, so it is a challenge for those with narrow feet to get properly outfitted. ""If your shoes are too loose, your foot may slide around inside, causing uncomfortable friction and blisters,"" says Havey, adding that you also could twist an ankle. This technique cinches up the shoe from bottom to top, keeping your foot in place to prevent injuries.</p>
<h3>
<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Narrow-foot lock lacing</h3>
<p>Thread your laces as you would normally through the first and second eyelets. Then thread the laces down through the next eyelets up on the same side to create a lock. Now cross the laces back over and weave them under the lock. Continue this lace-lock pattern all the way to the top of the shoe.</p>
<h6>Oxygen Magazine/Lock lacing</h6>
<h3>
<strong>ISSUE: </strong> Heel slippage</h3>
<p>If you've ever wondered what that ""extra"" eyelet at the top of your shoe is for, you're about to find out: ""Use the eyelets closest to your ankle joint to stop your heel from slipping or lifting,"" Havey says. This usually occurs if you have narrow ankles or heels or if your shoe is a little too big. Slippage can lead to blisters, hot spots or even a twisted ankle, so use this lacing technique to secure your heel into place.</p>
<h3>
<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Lock lacing</h3>
<p>Lace your shoe as you would normally all the way to the top. Then thread the laces down through those ""extra"" eyelets closest to your ankles and pull them through until there is a small loop remaining. Cross the laces over and through the loops on opposite sides and pull to tighten and lock down.</p>
<h6>Oxygen Magazine/Wide-foot lacing</h6>
<h3>
<strong>ISSUE: </strong> Wide forefoot or pinched toes</h3>
<p>Having a wide forefoot can spell a tight squeeze with many shoe brands, even if they are designed for wider appendages. This can mean undue pressure and blisters on your big and/or pinkie toes or a pinching together of your toes, which can lead to impingement over time. This lacing technique releases some of the tension across the front of the shoe, creating more space for your foot to spread out.</p>
<h3>
<strong>SOLUTION: </strong> Wide-foot lacing</h3>
<p>Thread the laces down through the first eyelets on either side, up through the second eyelets on the same side, then down through the third eyelets on the same side. Now lace diagonally as you would normally to the top.</p>

<div><hr></div>
<div>
<p>Like most of us, you probably don’t give your knees much thought. Until they hurt. <br><br>If you are an active person experiencing pain on the outside of your knees, the culprit might be Iliotibial Band Syndrome (IT Band Syndrome), a condition caused by repetitive bending at the knee. This condition afflicts the band of fibers that run from the top of your shin to the top of your hip. While painful, this condition is relatively easy to treat, so you don’t have to let it slow you down for long.</p>
</div>
<h2>IT Band Syndrome Causes</h2>
<div>
<p>Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome most often afflicts active people who participate in running, cycling, swimming, etc. In fact, any activity that requires repetitive knee bending can cause this condition, although it may most often be associated with distance runners. This condition occurs when the IT band of fibers becomes tight and irritates the knee, causing various unpleasant symptoms.<br><br>You are more likely to develop this problem if you fail to warm-up adequately and/or if you run frequently on uneven or hard surfaces. You may also have existing conditions that make you vulnerable to IT band syndrome, such as legs of differing length and weakness in your hips.</p>
</div>
<h2>IT Band Syndrome Symptoms</h2>
<div>
<p>You may be suffering from this condition if you notice pain while running or otherwise putting stress on the outside of your knee. When the tightened IT Band rubs against your knee, you may also feel a clicking sensation. You may also find that your knee is swollen, red and tender. Your buttocks can also become sensitive. The pain usually begins shortly after you begin the activity and continues for some time afterword. If you continue the activity that is irritating the IT fibers, the pain and other symptoms will simply become worse, sometimes unbearably so.</p>
</div>
<h2>IT Band Syndrome Treatment</h2>
<div>
<p>Your medical professional will need to evaluate you to try and determine exactly what is causing your tight iliotibial band. For relief, they may recommend the traditional PRICE treatment, meaning protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation as well as IT band syndrome specific exercises and stretches. Sometimes, the doctor may also prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs. If you develop IT band syndrome, you will be asked to at least temporarily refrain from the activity causing your pain.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet Insoles for IT Band Syndrome</h2>
<div>

<p>Whether you’ve been wearing Superfeet for years, or you’re still deciding on your first pair (we’ve got a <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"">quiz</a> for that!) you’re likely interested in what sets Superfeet apart from other insoles. In our series Superfeet: Steps Ahead, we’re highlighting just a few of the many reasons Superfeet come out on top when compared to a variety of insoles and shoe inserts.</p>
<p>One huge benefit Superfeet provide is a structured heel cup that cradles the back of your foot. It keeps the soft tissue under your heel bone contained in place so it can absorb vibrations as you move. That tissue works like suspension springs and dampers on a car, giving you the smoothest ride possible whether walking, running, hiking, or just going about your day. Not having proper shock absorption under your heel can have reverberating effects that lead to fatigue and discomfort in your entire body, not just your feet.</p>
<p>See the Superfeet difference for yourself in the video below.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Heel Support</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Arch support is an important factor to consider when choosing an insole, but equally important, and often overlooked, is the structure around your heel. Every pair of Superfeet, from the firm foundation of Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"">All-Purpose</a> insoles to the flexible comfort of <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">Run Cushion</a> insoles, has a structured heel cup that cradles the back of your foot, keeping it stable and cupping the soft tissue under your heel bone.</p>
<p>As you take each step, adding up to thousands per day on average, Superfeet insoles hug your heels, keeping the tissue under your heel bone contained where it can soften impact, instead of that tissue flattening out. If your insole doesn’t have a structured heel cup, you’re not getting full support.</p>

<h2>The Superfeet Difference</h2>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>As demonstrated by Hank and his friends in the video, your heel can be treated very differently depending on the support that is (or isn’t) in your shoes. We know you likely won’t be dropping books on your heels anytime soon, but the forces those books exert on the structure of each insole or shoe insert are a perfect test of their strength.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the factory liner in your shoes can’t provide the full support your feet crave, and many insoles that appear to have good arch support don’t do anything for your heel. Even insoles with a seemingly supportive heel cup just flatten out because the structure isn’t strong enough to withstand the forces acting on your feet as you move.</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles provide ultimate rearfoot support by cupping and stabilizing the heel tissue to help absorb vibrations that cause discomfort and pain in your feet, joints, and even your back. That rearfoot support combined with high quality, durable materials and the signature <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"">Superfeet shape</a> engineered to give your feet the perfect arch support right where you need it, means that whether you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/dress"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/dress"">everyday comfort</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles/pain-relief"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles/pain-relief"">pain relief</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">advanced performance</a>, or all of the above – you’ll find it with Superfeet.</p>

<p>Haglund's deformity, named after the doctor who first described it, is as pleasant as it sounds. This condition affects both the soft tissue near your heel and the heel bone, often making any foot movement difficult. This area develops a large bump that is continually irritated by stiff and/or tight shoes. In some instances, Haglund's deformity can lead to bursitis, a more serious condition. This foot issue can be painful and is progressive, so you need to take steps to prevent or treat the condition.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Haglund's Deformity</h2>
<div>
<p>Unlike some podiatric conditions, Haglund's deformity affects the bone as well as the tissue. The bone can rub against the heel tissue by the <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/achilles-tendonitis-explained"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/achilles-tendonitis-explained"">Achilles tendon</a>, irritating it and the bursa that lies between the bone and the tendon. The bursa contains fluid to allow free and easy tissue movement in the heel. When the bursa is affected, it can become thick and inflamed, causing the bump. Once the bump appears, pressure from shoes and activity make it worse, and a painful cycle begins.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of Haglund's Deformity</h2>
<div>
<p>If you have this problem, you will notice a large, often painful bump on the back of your heel. Your heel will often swell and display redness as well, and the point where your heel and Achilles tendon attach may be extremely painful.</p>
</div>
<figure><picture> <source> <img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Drawing of a foot with the heel area circled illustrating where walking in pumps rubs the stiff shoe material up and down the heel."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Blog-Foot-Health_Foot-Haglunds.jpg""></picture><picture> </picture></figure>
<h2>Treatment for Haglund's Deformity</h2>
<div>
<p>If you suffer from any of these symptoms, you should visit your doctor to get a formal diagnosis. Experts warn that Haglund's deformity often looks like other podiatric conditions, so it may be hard to identify. Your doctor will examine the look of your heel and possibly order an x-ray to confirm this ailment.<br><br>Once you have been diagnosed, you will need to wear shoes that do not put pressure on your heel as often as possible. Slingback shoes, sandals and clogs are possible options for your footwear. In addition to taking mild OTC pain relievers, you may be asked to ice your foot and have it massaged. Ultrasound treatments are effective for some sufferers.<br><br>In more extreme instances, your doctor may perform surgery to remove some of the bony mass from your heel.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet for Haglund's Deformity</h2>
<div>
<p>Prevention of conditions like Haglund’s deformity starts by wearing supportive and properly fitting footwear. And when that type of footwear isn’t an option, <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">adding an insole like Superfeet</a> to your footwear is key.

<p>Shin splints are a condition that sounds minor but is anything but. The pain from shin splints can impair your mobility and prevent you from pursuing activities that you enjoy. Shin splints need to be taken seriously and treated promptly.</p>
</div>
<h2>What are Shin Splints?</h2>
<div>
<p>Shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), are caused by injury and inflammation that provokes pain on either the inside or outside of the lower leg, or tibia. This type of pain can also be caused by a stress fracture or compartment syndrome. Those conditions require sophisticated medical tests to diagnose, but shin splints can usually be identified by the type of pain you experience. Experts note that shin splints cause a generalized pain that is often worse in the morning. If you have shin splints, flexing your foot at the ankle may be extremely painful.</p>
</div>
<h2>Causes of Shin Splints</h2>
<div>
<p>Shin splints can be a problem for runners and other athletes who put a great deal of repetitive force on their feet and legs. Sometimes, poor training techniques lead to this condition as well as failure to properly rest the legs and feet after they have been seriously stressed. Beginning athletes often fall prey to shin splints because they push themselves too far, too fast, too soon.</p>
</div>
<h2>Treatments for Shin Splints</h2>
<div>
<p>Medical professionals recommend a variety of treatments for shin splints. If you have this problem, you should greatly reduce your activity level to give the leg a chance to heal. If you are a runner, you should run at least 50 percent less and lengthen the time between runs until the condition improves. Icing the affected leg for 10 to 15 minutes after a workout can help prevent inflammation while using a compression bandage can also aid in healing. Simple elevation can also promote healing as can massage. In some instances, your medical professional will prescribe anti-inflammatories, including steroids, to speed healing.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet Help for Shin Splints</h2>
<div>
<p>For most people, using the proper foot support can both help prevent shin splints and help them heal. Be sure to wear footwear designed specifically for your activity, and wear Superfeet insoles to disperse ground impact forces and reduce strain on the lower leg.</p>

<div><p>You are enjoying your run. <br><br>Suddenly, you stop in your tracks because you feel a tight, sharp pain sensation in your left calf muscle. You quickly grab hold your leg. You take deep breaths, limp to the safest place for recovery and take a break. You continue to viciously massage the hard-lump tissue in your calf muscle until the lump disappears and the pain subsides. You abandon the run and decide to walk the rest of the way.<br><br>What caused your leg cramps? How can proper nutrition prevent leg cramps from happening on your next run? What are the best vitamins and supplements for leg cramps?  Read on to learn the best way to prevent and treat leg muscle cramps. </p></div>
<h2>What causes leg muscle cramps in runners?</h2>
<div><p>Muscle spasms or leg cramps are caused by the sudden an involuntary contraction of one of more your muscles, resulting in a painful sensation that will often cause you to completely stop your run. Leg cramps are caused by a number of issues: overuse of the muscles, working out too hard, taking extremely long walks, runs or hikes, improperly stretching or not stretching at all, inactivity, and electrolyte imbalances. The painful feeling from muscle spasms can last from seconds to several minutes, and sometimes days.</p></div>
<h2>Risk factors for leg muscle cramps</h2>
<div>
<p>Generally, leg cramps are harmless. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, some may be related to underlying medical conditions like inadequate blood supply, nerve compression, and mineral depletion (having a diet low in Potassium, Calcium or Magnesium). </p>
<p>You may be at greater risk of experiencing muscle cramps if you are an older adult. People lose muscle mass as they age, so the remaining muscles can become overstressed easily. Athletes become fatigued and dehydrated from electrolyte imbalances, especially when exercising in warm weather. Pregnant women, and individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses like diabetes, nerve, liver or thyroid conditions may also be at greater risk of experiencing muscle cramps.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to prevent leg muscle cramps</h2>
<div><p>Eating well-balanced meals and snacks can decrease the incidence of leg cramps in athletes. It is imperative that an individual meet the daily requirements of both macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat and water), and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) for healthy muscle contraction.</p></div>
<h2>What to eat to prevent leg muscle cramps: micronutrients</h2>

Each of these nutrients plays a significant role in healthy muscle contraction.</p></div>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.eatright.org/"">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>, <a href=""https://www.dietitians.ca/"">Dietitians of Canada</a> and the <a href=""https://www.acsm.org/"">American College of Sports Medicine</a> all recommend consuming between 1.2 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day — that's 0.5 to 0.8 grams per pound of body weight. Eat quality proteins, like lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy or soy, and be sure protein intake is spread evenly throughout the day.</p>
<p>While protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, the right intake of carbohydrates and fat is important for refueling your muscles and preventing leg cramps. The Institute of Medicine's recommended dietary allowance of carbohydrates for all adults is 130 grams per day. The carbohydrate requirement for runners and high-performance athletes generally exceeds this recommendation.</p>
<p>As for fat intake, consume low-fat entrees to prevent gastrointestinal distress during exercise. </p>
<p>Dehydration is also commonly associated with leg cramps. Drinking plenty of water helps your muscles contract and relax and keeps muscle cells hydrated. Recommended water intake depends on factors like age, health, prescribed medications, what you eat, activity level and weather conditions. It's a good idea to drink fluids regularly throughout the day, before workouts, during workouts and after workouts.  While eating a well-balanced diet to meet your daily micronutrient requirements is the best way to go, you may choose to supplment your intake with vitamins or supplements to help prevent leg cramps. </p>
</div>
<h2>What are the best vitamins and supplements for leg cramps?</h2>
<div>
<p>A well-balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, lean sources of proteins, beans and healthy fats should meet your nutritional needs without supplementation. Supplements should never take the place of eating well-balanced meals and snacks. </p>
<p>However, a busy schedule or dietary restrictions can make eating well-balanced meals and snacks challenging. Therefore, taking multivitamins/multimineral supplements from a reliable source is recommended. In fact, taking a one-a-day multivitamin/multimineral can compensate for daily inadequacies, improve overall health and help prevent chronic disease.</p>
<p>To manage leg cramps effectively, focusing on a balanced intake of vitamins and minerals is crucial. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium, for muscle relaxation and nerve function</li>
<li>Potassium, crucial for muscle contractions and nerve signals</li>
<li>Calcium, essential for proper muscle contractions and nerve signaling</li>
<li>Vitamin E, known for its role in improving blood flow and may help prevent cramps</li>
<li>Vitamin D, to enhance the body's absorption of calcium</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of consultation cannot be overstated — speak with your doctor or registered dietitian to learn more about supplements before taking any.</p>

<div>Per capita, the sensational views on mountain trails in Colorado is, literally, sky high. Trails explore deep forests, high mountains, tranquil deserts, and alpine meadows. For the aspiring trail runner, this is a bounty of adventure that offers a lifetime of possibilities.</div>
<section>
<p>You don't have to be an elite ultramarathoner or seeker of the <a href=""http://fastestknowntime.proboards.com/board/14/west-az-mt-nv-nm"">fastest known time</a> (FKT) on a given <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/colorados-top-ten-must-hike-14ers"">14er</a> to enjoy the trails. The average fit, fast-packing citizen can take any of the following trails to huge visual payoffs.</p>
<p><strong>1) Mesa Trail in Boulder</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--OlO02pS5--/t_rr_large_traditional/zlsrkdji7g2pumm7mszv.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Chautauqua Park, Colorado. <small><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/salilwadhavkar/5111654994/in/photolist-7pVqfX-fNfxwA-CQfi5-4mV3r2-8MGyWE-dibTsi-dibSht-5qeUYc-dic1qZ-xp78Ea-pPbh64-e4Sk3E-bMAqs-5o1gLJ-AJrNT8-AJrjqg-AwT8E1-Ahzjuw"">Salil Wadhavkar</a></small></sub></sup></p>

<p>Running along the foothills of Boulder, from Chautauqua Park at the north end to Eldorado Canyon Road to the south, the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/boulder-co/trail-running/mesa-trail-trail-running"">Mesa Trail</a> is a great option. Run it in out and back for a 12-mile outing with 3,250 feet of climbing. You’ll spend most of your time around 5,500 feet, but peak at an elevation of 6,465 feet.</p>
<p>Most of the middle miles of the trail cuts through old-growth forest, so it’s shaded. But a mile or two on both ends are exposed, so slather on the sunscreen. From the Chautauqua trailhead, you can add a mile by taking the even more scenic and challenging Bluebell Trail detour. In any case, expect to see rocky outcroppings and the city below this popular trail.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, runners can make spectacular loops by splitting off several trails, such as Fern Canyon, Shadow Canyon, and the Green-Bear Trail, to get above Boulder's iconic Flatirons and add some serious elevation to their runs. These trails all feed into the Mesa Trail as it skirts the base of the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>2) Mount Falcon, Morrison</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--jdw4b983--/t_rr_large_traditional/yd2lcgcifprvft5kzf97.jpg"">

<p>A 40-minute drive west of downtown Denver is Mount Falcon Park near Morrison. There are <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/denver-co/mountain-biking/castle-trail-at-mount-falcon-park"">many trails</a> here with fantastic views of the Front Range, Red Rocks Amphitheater, and Denver proper. Some are flat and wide, friendly to mountain bikers and jogging strollers, while others include more strenuous ascents. Runs of three to nearly eight miles can be had by combining trails.</p>
<p>The park includes the remains of the home of John Brisben Walker, who developed the Red Rocks Amphitheater. The foundation of the summer home Walker began to build, intended as a retreat for for U.S. presidents, can also be seen. It was this structure that cost Walker his fortune in the 1900s.</p>
<p><strong>3) Turquoise Lake, Leadville</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--stFGmppA--/t_rr_large_traditional/dkl6tp0dxqliarzb3ug7.jpg"">

</figure>
<p>The <a href=""http://1.usa.gov/29596cj"">Turquoise Lake Nature Trail</a> just outside Leadville is gently rolling but remains challenging due to it’s location 10,000 feet above sea level. With several 14ers as a backdrop, the 12-mile out-and back trail hugs the shoreline of the calm lake. Its epic feel intensifies with the knowledge that the storied <a href=""http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/run/leadvilletrail100run/"">Leadville 100</a> ultramarathon course uses this path twice (at the 10- and 80-mile marks).</p>
<p><strong>4) Argentine Pass out of Peru Creek/Horseshoe Basin, Montezuma</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--nNpPld5l--/t_rr_large_traditional/l2ruefmasbh0iqqu8lny.jpg"">
<p><sup><sub>Argentine Peak, Colorado. <small><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/ben-dwest/9309611505/in/photolist-fbeQL3-fbUoRU-fbeR1L-faZzNi-fbUqXA-fbE7n8-fbEbaH-fbEaEc-fbUrZQ-fbUsAQ-fbEcac"">Ben Deutsch</a></small></sub></sup></p>
</figure>
<p>The trailhead for Argentine Pass (13,207 feet) is at the end of the easy 4x4 Peru Creek Road near Montezuma in Summit County. The pass follows the crest of the Front Range of the Rockies and crosses the Continental Divide. From the top of the pass, strong runners can continue along the ridges to 13,743' Argentine Peak, 13,856' Mount Edwards, or even all the way to  14,278' Grays Peak.</p>
<p>The distance to the ridge on the Horseshoe Basin side, accessible only by foot or mountain bike, is 2.6 steep miles; the climb gains 2,000 feet. The trail then continues up Argentine Peak to the Continental Divide. The trail is rocky but in good shape, making it prime terrain for high-altitude adventures. It's also possible to run from the east side of the pass starting at the Waldorf Mine 4x4 road and trailhead.</p>
<p>As you run it, try to imagine the original Argentine Pass Trail as the wagon trail it was in the late 1800s between Georgetown and the mining camps on the western slope of the divide.</p>
<p><strong>5) Animas Mountain, Durango</strong></p>
<figure><img src=""https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--XmpDG5v4--/t_rr_large_traditional/boz7gc1pah5pwsijjetk.jpg"">

<p>The six-mile Durango area loop that starts with 2.5 miles up <a href=""https://www.rootsrated.com/durango-co/trail-running/animas-mountain-trail-running?%20__hstc=112078491.eca9d124da3ec5a80378353cda429238.1467196587639.1467196587639.1467196587639.1&amp;__%20hssc=112078491.1.1467196587640&amp;__hsfp=1434411348"">Animas Mountain</a> is a rocky grind that demands concentration. But the trail around the top of the hill delivers great views of Durango, the Animas River Valley, and the La Plata Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>6) Lost Man Loop, Leadville</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/aspen-co/trail-running/lost-man-valley-trail-running"">Lost Man Loop</a> connects two trailheads along Highway 82 close to Independence Pass. The Lower Lost Man Loop starts in the woods before it climbs and opens up into a stunning alpine meadow valley. High ridges run in just about every direction from here. Aim to reach Upper Lost Man Lake to see Geissler Mountain, Twining Peak, and the surrounding summits. Avoid this trail in the spring when there’s still snow above the treeline and muddy meltwater running down the trail.</p>
<p><strong>7) Pawnee Pass Trail, Nederland</strong></p>

<p>This difficult but popular trail offers a 9-mile trip from in the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/brainard-lake-peak-bagging-an-insider-s-guide"">Brainard Lake Recreation Area</a>of the Indian Peaks Wilderness to Pawnee Peak and back. The 12,943' peak, just a half mile off the trail, rewards with sweet views of the Indian Peaks and Wild Basin Area of Rocky Mountain National Park. Before turning back, continue west on the main trail to the sign indicating the Continental Divide at the top of the pass and Pawnee Lake <em> </em> comes into view <em>. </em></p>
<p><strong>8) Buchanan Pass, Ward</strong></p>

</figure>
<p>Beginning at Camp Dick Campground a few miles north of Ward, the initially flat Buchanan Pass Trail runs nine miles west, partly along Middle St. Vrain Creek, to Buchanan Pass (11,837 feet) on the Continental Divide. View Timberline Falls from above, but watch your step as you do so. A dicey foot bridge leads to Coney Flats, a marshy area where you may catch sight of moose. Above a talus field a little farther on, you'll see Sawtooth Mountain, the Indian Peaks to the south, and Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park to the north.</p>
<p>Turn back here at the 3.85-mile mark or proceed west to St. Vrain Glacier, St. Vrain Mountain, and Red Deer Lake.</p>
<p><strong>9) Imogene Pass, Telluride-Ouray</strong></p>

<p>Connecting the small mountain towns of Telluride and Ouray is Imogene Pass, a 17-mile dirt road. The towns sit at elevations of 8,750 feet and 7,810 feet respectively, but the pass between them reaches 13,114 feet, the second highest in Colorado.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/imogene-pass-run-everything-need-know-famed-trail-race"">Imogene Pass Run</a> from Ouray to Telluride, held every April, has long served as a training run for the Pike’s Peak Marathon. Seeing as Imogene Pass runners find themselves well above the treeline, it’s easy to understand why.</p>
<p><strong>10) Four Pass Loop, Aspen</strong></p>

<p>You could take a leisurely three to four days, like many backpackers do, to cover the 26.4-mile <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/aspen-co/backpacking-camping/four-pass-loop"">Four Pass Loop</a> through the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness and not be disappointed. You could also run this route as a marathon (plus .2 miles) and put a notch in your Fuel Belt for each of the four 12,000-foot passes you conquer. If you do the latter, promise to take time to stop and drink in the Maroon Bells—among the most photographed peaks in North America—waterfalls hundreds of feet high, and mountain lakes rimmed with wildflowers.</p>
<p>Start the loop at Maroon Lake in either direction, although most hikers do it clockwise for the easier initial ascent and best scenery at the end.</p>
<p><strong>11) Crag Crest Trail, Grand Junction</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.visitgrandjunction.com/crag-crest-trail-grand-junction-colorado"">Crag Crest National Recreation Trail</a> is a 10.3-mile loop that takes in Grand Mesa, said to be the world’s largest flat-topped mountain. The 350,000-acre <a href=""http://www.visitgrandjunction.com/exploring-grand-mesa-national-forest"">Grand Mesa National Forest</a> east of Grand Junction includes some 300 lakes, deep pine forest, and lots of trails.</p>
<p>The 6.5-mile trail to Crag Crest (11,189 feet) follows a narrow ridge with steep drop-offs. From Leon Peak, the highest point, are grand views in all directions of the Elk, Uncompahgre, Lizard Head, and Raggeds wildernesses. Also visible are five 14'ers in the San Juan Range. And on especially clear days runners can see out to the La Sal Mountains in western Colorado and eastern Utah.</p>
<p>A 3.4-mile loop section, where mountain bikers and horseback riders are allowed to join those on foot, is a means of returning to Eggleston Lake, 1,000 feet below on the east end of the mesa.</p>

<p>A crucial and dreaded section of the Leadville 100 course (there’s a reason the aid station just shy of the peak is called “Hopeless”), this 9-mile out-and-back route connects other trails from the Willis Gulch Trailhead about 25 miles southwest of Leadville. <a href=""http://www.leadvilletwinlakes.com/hopepass"">Hope Pass</a>runners gain 4,500 feet to views of Missouri Mountain, Mount Belford, Mount Oxford, and Huron Peak.</p>

The main approach is from the Clear Creek/South Winfield Trailhead 20 miles south of Leadville and 14.5 miles north of Buena Vista.</p>
<p>From the 2WD parking lot at Winfield Ghost Town, the trek is an 11-mile round trip. But if you have a vehicle that can get you to the trailhead, you can shave 3.25 miles off your hike, although you’ll still have 3,500 feet of climbing to do.</p>
<p>Take a break there to view Browns Peak (13,523) before continuing on to the peak. The final stretch is a bit tricky but not enough to keep you from bagging this summit and being able to say you looked down on the down on the 13’ers of the Three Apostles—North Apostle, Ice Mountain and West Apostle.</p>

<p>With grades as steep as 68 percent on its short ascent, the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/denver-co/hiking/manitou-incline"">Manitou Incline</a> is less a running trail than a physical challenge very popular among overachievers in the Colorado Springs area. At its base in Manitou Springs, the elevation is 6,600 feet. The top is only .88 of a mile away but a 2,000-foot climb.</p>
<p>The trail was built in 1907 as a funicular railway to a hydroelectric plant and water tanks at the top of the mountain. It was in operation until 1990 when a rock slide took out the tracks and the railroad company opted not to repair them. Railroad ties now serve as steps for intrepid climbers. From the top, hikers descend on <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/colorado-springs-co/hiking/barr-trail-hiking"">Barr Trail</a>, a much gentler three-mile descent. Climbers can bailout on the Barr Trail two-thirds of the way up, just before the climb is at its steepest.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that scaling the Manitou Incline is a popular feat to undertake, and repeatedly, by residents of the large military bases and U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Records are kept for the fastest and most frequent summits.</p>

<p>Bunions sound like a harmless affliction. Many people see them as simple yet painful bumps on the side of the foot that are a minor annoyance. In truth, bunions are a malformation of the foot that can make walking and even standing difficult. Although people usually inherit the bone structure that causes bunions, you can take steps to slow their formation and treat them when they appear.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is a bunion?</h2>
<div>
<p>A bunion looks and feels like a hard bump on the side of your foot. Bunions can develop on either the inside or outside of the foot, but are typically found near the base of the big toe. These bumps can make finding shoes that fit difficult, but, at first, they may not be painful. More serious symptoms generally appear over time.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of a bunion</h2>
<div>
<p>The main symptom of this condition is a large bump to the side of your big toe. The bump is often red and sore, causing serious pain. The toe joint may develop arthritis, making movement even more difficult. You may also develop corns at the site of the bunion due to its pressing on the side of shoes. Bunions can make standing for long periods extremely painful, so some jobs become difficult to perform. Medical professionals, salespeople and others who are constantly on their feet may find bunions difficult to handle.</p>
</div>

<h2>Causes of a bunion</h2>
<div>
<p>Bunions are caused by excessive motion, stress and pressure on a bone, which leads to excess bone growth and inflammation of the tissue. Wearing tight-fitting shoes can exacerbate and accelerate the condition.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can Superfeet help relieve pain from bunions?</h2>
<div>
<p>For some people, simply changing ill-fitting footwear can ease the pain and slow down bunion development. Look for footwear with ample room in the toe box to relieve pressure and friction off painful areas. For prevention of bunions, the gentle orthotic shape of <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">Superfeet inserts</a> can help reduce excess motion, minimizing stress and strain on the big toe joint.</p>

<div>
<p>Your foot has more than 100 tendons, ligaments and muscles, all of them necessary to provide stability and mobility for your body. When even one of these structures becomes injured or inflamed, you may experience difficulty going about your daily tasks or pursuing your favorite physical activities. Peroneal tendonitis is one foot and ankle condition that can make your life difficult.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Peroneal Tendonitis?</h2>
<div>
<p>The peroneal tendons run along the outside of your leg and loop under the bony part of the ankle. They then attach muscles to both the outside of your foot and near the arch. When these tendons rub up against this bony part, known as the lateral malleolus, they can become irritated, swell and even tear. This condition can afflict anyone, but it more often strikes athletes, especially runners.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of Peroneal Tendonitis?</h2>
<div>
<p>If you develop pain behind your ankle that eases when you rest, you may have peroneal tendonitis. Other symptoms include swelling at the back of your ankle and pain when you turn your foot. At times, you may wobble when your ankle fails to support you properly. You may also notice that the skin in the afflicted area feels warm.</p>
</div>
<h2>Causes of Peroneal Tendonitis</h2>
<div>
<p>As with many podiatric conditions, peroneal tendonitis is associated with repetitive ankle motion and stress. Runners, soccer players and dancers are at particular risk for this issue, which often appears after years of stress on the foot and ankle. Sometimes, the condition develops quickly after an injury or sudden strain on the tendons. For instance, an ankle sprain can often lead to peroneal tendonitis.</p>
</div>
<h2>Treatment for Peroneal Tendonitis</h2>
<div>
<p>If you experience these symptoms, you should visit your medical professional who will conduct mobility and possibly imaging tests to diagnose your problem. Once they have determined that peroneal tendonitis is the culprit, your doctor will likely prescribe rest until the pain and swelling dissipate. As with most foot and/or ankle issues, ice and heat may help soothe the tendons. You may also be asked to wear a supportive boot or another device to keep your ankle immobile. OTC pain relievers help many sufferers, but in more severe cases, you may be prescribed cortisone injections. Surgery is rarely indicated.</p>
</div>

<p>Be sure to wear supportive, activity-specific footwear, especially during high impact activities. <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">A structured insole that keeps its shape</a> (stay away from flimsy foams or squishy gels) should also become part of your everyday wardrobe, both in and out of activity, for support, performance and protection from injury.</p>

<div>
<p>For most people, strolling down the street is a simple, painless act. Unfortunately, those with foot issues may find even a short walk agonizing and difficult to complete. A foot neuroma, also known as Morton's neuroma, is a common affliction that can cause serious discomfort, and yet many people don't know what it is. If you are experiencing pain in your toes or the balls of your feet, you may be suffering from this condition.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is a Morton's Neuroma?</h2>
<div>
<p>A Morton's neuroma can be either a pinched nerve or a thickening of the tissue around a nerve, usually between the third and fourth toe, causing pain and numbness. Although some men suffer from this condition, the majority of patients are women, in part due to footwear choices. Although neuromas are generally not considered serious, they can greatly limit mobility and so need to be treated.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of a Morton's Neuroma</h2>
<div>
<p>Neuromas cause pain and/or numbness while you are walking or otherwise engaged in physical activity. The discomfort is usually located near the toes or on the ball of the feet. Some sufferers feel as if they have a rock or marble in their shoe and will pause to remove their footwear and rub the sore spot. There may also be visible swelling between the affected toes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Causes of a Morton's Neuroma</h2>
<div>
<p>Some experts believe that neuromas may be caused by other foot problems, including <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/flat-feet-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/flat-feet-explained"">flat feet</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/high-arches-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/high-arches-explained"">high arches</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/bunions-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/bunions-explained"">bunions</a>. Any sport that puts pressure on the foot may also contribute to the development of a neuroma, so runners can be susceptible to this ailment. Wearing high heels may be the biggest factor in the development of neuromas. High heels shift the wearer's weight forward, putting excess pressure on the toes and balls of the feet. This pressure sometimes results in nerve issues. This cause would also explain why so many women develop this condition. In fact, any type of ill-fitting shoes can lead to the development of a neuroma.</p>
</div>
<h2>Treatments for a Morton's Neuroma</h2>
<div>
<p>Once your doctor has diagnosed a neuroma, often using a variety of tests, they will prescribe various treatments. Icing the affected area may reduce the pain and swelling in the foot. Some OTC medications may help, including ibuprofen. Your doctor may also urge you to reduce your physical activity until your condition improves. In more extreme cases, the neuroma may be treated by cortisone injections or even surgery.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet Help for a Morton's Neuroma</h2>
<div>
<p>Doctors recommend that sufferers wear shoes with heel no higher than two inches. Shoes should have a room toe box and either have built in support, or added support through the addition of an insole, like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">Superfeet</a>. The orthotic shape of Superfeet cradles the foot and can help redistribute pressure, giving your forefoot some relief. If you must wear heels, be sure to wear <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/everyday-high-heel"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/everyday-high-heel"">shoe inserts designed especially for high-heeled footwear</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Neuromas can keep you off of your feet and out of action. If you are suffering from toe pain, numbness or swelling, visit your doctor for a diagnosis. Then follow their treatment prescriptions, including <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-insoles"">using insoles</a> and wearing foot-friendly shoes.</p>

<div>
<p>They say you can tell a lot about a person from their shoes. Do you like to wear sneakers or dress shoes? Flats or high heels? Do you rock spotless kicks without a single scuff or work boots that have lasted through years of wear and tear?</p>
<p>Whatever you have on your feet, making your footwear as comfortable as possible not only feels better but actually helps reduce the likelihood of injuries. <a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"" title=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"">Researc</a><a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"">h</a> backs up the intuitive notion that when your feet are comfortable, they follow their preferred movement patterns, reducing stress and strain.</p>
<p>But even the cushiest, most contoured shoes often can’t provide the ideal support for your feet, let alone footwear without any arch support or cushion whatsoever. Superfeet insoles are the perfect missing puzzle piece between the shape of your feet and the inside of your shoes. “Our insoles help to serve as an adaptor between the two-dimensional surface of the inside of the shoe and your three-dimensional foot, helping to personalize the fit and feel of any shoe,” says Matt Gooch, Certified Pedorthist and Vice President of Product and Innovation at Superfeet.</p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The Benefits of Insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Why use insoles? Because your feet deserve better than the flat surface or factory sockliner in your shoes. Most footwear is designed with special attention paid to the outside – the color, the style, how it interacts with the ground – but that means the inside can get overlooked. It’s no secret that how a shoe feels to wear isn’t top of mind, especially for casual and dress shoes.</p>
<p>Even supportive running shoes might not have exactly the right kind of support for your feet, or simply not have enough of it. Superfeet insoles let you turn any shoe into the most comfortable pair you’ve ever had. Whether you need cushion and flexibility under your feet or firm structure to support your ar<span>ches, there’s a Superfeet pair for you. There are also Superfeet insoles for reducing foot pain and discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span>“Research has shown that adding an insole will make the shoe more comfortable for the overwhelming majority of people. Simply put, adding the right shape under the foot helps improve the fit and feel of the shoe. But different people have different needs and preferences when it comes to insoles. That's why we have spent the last seven years doing research with some of the world's leading biomechanists at the University of Calgary,” says Matt Gooch. “We have focused on trying to clearly define what makes a specific insole comfortable to an individual person.” </span></p>
<p><span>Superfeet insoles help stabilize your feet as move, which can improve efficiency while walking and running and reduces strain not just on your feet but on your knees and back as well. Keeping your feet supported and comfortable sets a strong foundation for the rest of your body.</span></p>
<p><span>Choosing Superfeet insoles for better shoe fit and support provides many benefits beyond just giving more cushion under your feet</span>.</p>

<div>
<h2>Superfeet Insoles: What Sets Them Apart</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>At Superfeet, we utilize innovative and cutting-edge materials coupled with proprietary design and technology (not to mention over 40 years of knowledge diving deep into the science of comfort) but the thing that truly sets Superfeet insoles apart is simple: the signature Superfeet shape.</p>
<p>“Some people function better with what we refer to as a lower dose of Superfeet shape, meaning the insole is made of more flexible, cushioned materials like those that feature our patented Adaptive Comfort Technology™. Others prefer a higher dose of Superfeet shape, meaning the insole is made of more structured and supportive materials like those that feature our EVOLyte® technology,” says Matt Gooch.</p>
<p>Every pair of Superfeet insoles provide a contoured foundation for your arches and a cradling structure for your heels that gives your feet the support they need to move freely while remaining stable, stand strong for long periods without losing shape, and feel good at the end of the day. They are the perfe<span>ct arch support insoles for improving foot health and comfort.</span></p>
<p>Our most cushioned insoles flex with your movements but still provide enough presence to support the arches and maintain a contoured orthotic shape that matches the anatomy of the foot. Squishy gel inserts or foam insoles without arch support may feel soft but can’t give your feet the same stabilization and comfort provided by Superfeet.</p>
<p>Since beginning in 1977 as the Sports Medicine Division of Northwest Podiatric Laboratory, Superfeet has used science and biometric data as the driving force behind all products. That spirit of innovation and dedication to creating solutions continues today, exemplified in the cutting-edge materials and proprietary technology that sets Superfeet apart.</p>
<p>Many of our insoles feature EVOLyte® stabilizer caps infused with carbon fiber for incredibly strong yet lightweight and springy structure. Superfeet insoles with the most cushion use proprietary Adaptive Comfort Technology to flex and move with the foot – great for running and hiking footwear. Add Moisturewick top covers that help reduce odors and energizing foam under the whole foot and you get the ultimate experience in comfort and support.</p>

<h2>How to Choose the Right Superfeet Insole for Your Shoes</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>While your personal comfort preferences are k<span>ey, choosing the right insole for your specific shoe type and activity is also important. Insoles for dress shoes and high heels are different from insoles for running and athletic shoes or insoles for work boots. </span></p>
<p>An important thing to consider when picking insoles is how much room there is in your shoes. Do they fit tight to your feet or are they roomier around the sides and top? With the slim design of Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"">Run Support Low Arch</a>, even tight footwear like bike shoes or cleats can get the benefits of Superfeet shape.</p>
<p>Most sneakers and athletic shoes have removable liners that when taken out, leave plenty of room for Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">Run</a> insoles. Thicker insoles like Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"">All-Purpose High Impact Support</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"">Casual Support</a> work best in roomy footwear like boots or comfy casual shoes. You can take this <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/insole-finder"">quiz</a> to find which Superfeet insoles are right for you.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided which insoles work best for your use case and footwear, it’s important to find the right size. Because shoe sizes vary by brand and region, Superfeet insoles are in letter sizes that span one and half footwear sizes. All full-length Superfeet insoles should be trimmed to fit your footwear. If you are on the cusp or between sizes and aren’t sure which size to choose, keep in mind it’s most important that your heel fits well in the heel cup of the insole – it should be “in” the heel cup, not “on” it.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Trimming your insoles is easy: just take out the sockliner that came in your shoes, place it on top of your Superfeet insole so that the heels line up flush, then trace around the top of the sockliner with a pencil. Take the sockliner away and cut your Superfeet insoles along the line you just traced. There should be a small gap of 1 to 2 mm (that’s about the width of a nickel) between the Superfeet insole and the end of your footwear to prevent the insole creasing along the edges as you move. You can see the trimming process in this video.</p>

<h2>Tips for Using Superfeet Insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The arch shape of some Superfeet insoles may feel different than you expected. This design is intentional — the contours of each insole are positioned to have maximum impact on the way your foot functions as you move. For Superfeet insoles with firmer structure and support, breaking them in a few hours at a time can allow your feet to get accustomed to the new shape. Soon, your feet will not only get used to it but love the way Superfeet shape provides comfort and support. We feel so strongly about it, we offer a <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/60-day-guarantee"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/60-day-guarantee"">60-day comfort guarantee</a>.</p>
<p>Every pair of Superfeet insoles are made with durable materials that provide long-lasting comfort for up to 12 months or 500 miles, whichever comes first. You can wash your insoles occasionally with mild soap and lukewarm warm water. If needed, use an old toothbrush with soft bristles for extra scrubbing. After rinsing, dry with a towel and leave out to air dry. Excessive heat and insoles don’t mix, so machine washing and drying is never a good idea.</p>

<p><span>You decide to take a run.  </span></p>
<p><span>You start off strong with a burst of energy. </span></p>
<p><span>But thirty minutes into the run, you notice your body has started to slow down.  </span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Why are you feeling fatigued and sluggish so early in your run? More importantly, how can you prevent this feeling and stay energized while running?</span></p>
<h2>Runner’s Fatigue Syndrome</h2>
<p><span>At some point along the trail, runners may experience hunger or weakness, and feel sluggish, sleepy or dehydrated. It’s a feeling I like to call </span><i><span>runner fatigue syndrome.</span></i><span> This can occur in both short- and long-distance runs.</span></p>
<p><i><span>Runner fatigue syndrome</span></i><span> is when a runner experiences a plunge in energy during and after the body has used up its energy stores. As a result, runners progressively start feeling tired, dehydrated and even hungry. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>During a run, the body breaks down stored glycogen into glucose – this process is what supplies the muscles with enough power to fuel your run.  With increased heat and energy output, your body craves quick sources of fuels to keep fatigue at bay.</span></p>
<h2>Prevent Runner Fatigue Syndrome with a Mid-Run Snack</h2>
<p><span>Before I start with nutritious snacks ideas, I would like to share an important rule for exercising or training: Aim to drink 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes, for a run lasting 60 minutes or longer.  Proper hydration during exercise keeps the body replenished with electrolytes, and your internal thermostat regulated. </span></p>
<p><span> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_01-en-1552950255.jpg""></span></p>
<hr>
<p>Check out this easy homemade sports drink for runners to re-energize mid run:<br><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Add one pinch of salt (for sodium) and squeeze 1-2 tablespoons of fresh orange (for potassium and carbohydrates) to 32 ounces (4 cups) of water. </span></li>
<li><span>Shake and sip your homemade sports drink while on your run.</span></li>
<li><span>Alternative hydrating mid-run drinks: a bottle of coconut water or beet juice.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span>Some of my favorite re-energizing snacks to carry on your run: </span></p>
<h3>Option #1:</h3>
<p><span>Dried fruit mix. Dried fruits like bananas, cranberries, raisins, dates or apricots are quick energy boosters that will give the body fuel it needs to keep going and are easy to pop in your mouth in the middle of a run.    </span></p>
<h3>Option #2:<span> </span>
</h3>
<p><span>Honey packets. Honey is composed of two simple sugars — glucose and fructose — making it a direct source of quick energy to the bloodstream.  One honey packet provides 12 grams of carbohydrates (sugar) that will pick you up immediately in the middle of a run.</span></p>
<hr>
<div></div>
<hr>
<h3>Option #3:</h3>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_02-en-1552950340.jpg""></p>
<p><span>One cup pineapple chunks topped with one teaspoon ginger powder.  Pineapple provides 22g of total carbohydrates (including dietary fiber), 1.7 milligrams of sodium and 180 milligrams of potassium. Pineapple also contains a high level of the enzyme bromelain which serves as a natural anti-inflammatory to support ligaments and muscle cramping. Adding the ginger will give you an extra boost of energy. Ginger contains properties that delay onset muscle damage and soreness during and after exercising.</span></p>
<h3>
<br>Option #4:<span> </span>
</h3>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_03-en-1552950423.jpg""></p>
<p><span>¼ cup frozen watermelon and orange slices, topped with a pinch of salt.  A sprinkle of salt on frozen watermelon and orange slices will refuel and rehydrate your body during your run.  The salty and sweet taste of one serving of these fruits gives your body 11 grams of carbohydrates (watermelon) and 18 grams of carbohydrates (orange), totaling to 29 grams of carbohydrates, plus an enormous amount of potassium.  These fruits snacks can be packaged in a snack-sized bag and placed in your running belt.<br><br></span></p>
<h3>Option #5:<span> </span>
</h3>
<p><span>12 salted pretzels, saltine crackers or animal crackers. These mini snacks contain a significant amount of salt to keep your body’s sodium level balanced. They are low in calories, but add enough carbohydrates to keep you on course with your run.  These small mid-run snacks are convenient and easy to carry. They are also very low in fat and fiber, so you don’t have to worry about any gastrointestinal distress like bloating and diarrhea during prolonged runs. </span></p>
<h3>Option #6:<span> </span>
</h3>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_04-en-1552950488.jpg""></p>
<p><span>Beet juice. A newly-recognized resource for runners or athletes is beet juice. Beets have been shown to boost stamina to help you prolong your exercise routine, improve blood flow and lower blood pressure. Beets are rich in nitrates that get converted into nitric oxide in the body. This helps with blood flow. One study showed people who drank beet juice for six days had better stamina during prolonged exercise or trainings.<br></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>(Note: If you decide to drink beet juice to boost your energy, don’t be alarmed if your urine changes colors — that’s a natural occurrence.)</span></p>

<div>
<p>Did you know? Superfeet had its early beginnings in the ski industry.  One of the very first Superfeet, dubbed the Insta-Ski-Thotic, was a heat-molded cork insole developed in partnership with <a href=""https://www.nordica.com/usa/en"">Nordica</a> and custom-created for snow sport athletes on the US Olympic Team in the late 1970’s.</p>
<p>The founders of Superfeet recognized that snow sport boots, as a default, are often rigid and unforgiving and can be painful to wear for long periods of time. They embraced the challenge to create solutions to help boots fit and feel better. </p>
</div>
<figure><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Superfeet_Winter_Insoles_70s.png""></picture><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Superfeet_Winter_Insoles_70s.png""></picture></figure><div>
<p>And while most of us have left several things from the 70’s behind (we’re looking at you, one-piece bell-bottom snowsuit), the original idea behind the Insta-Ski-Thotic — to help your ski and snowboard boots fit and feel better, so you can stay on the mountain longer — lives on today. </p>
<p>We're pleased to be able to take the foundational elements of that signature Superfeet orthotic shape and combine them with the technology and materials of today to create two all-new Superfeet insoles especially made for your snowy pursuits. </p>
</div>
<h2>Introducing Superfeet WINTER Comfort and WINTER Comfort Thin — Your Season Pass to Comfort</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what makes these two new insoles for ski boots and snowboard boots so special.</p>
<p>Built on the foundation of our proprietary EVOLyte® carbon fiber infused stabilizer cap, Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/winter-support"">Winter Support</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/winter-support-thin"">Winter Thin Support</a> insoles deliver responsive support that keeps its shape through every turn.  Like their predecessors, these insoles feature medial and lateral support, giving you a secure fit and feel on both sides of your feet as you carve your path on the slopes.  Comfort foam with a thermal top cover provide long lasting warmth, cushioning and support.  Built with the signature deep heel cup Superfeet are known for, both new insoles cradle your heels to amplify your body’s own cushioning and keep you and your feet feeling great all season long.  Finally, beveled edges on the forefoot help improve fit and reduce tightness around the toes and make it easier to trim and drop into your boots. </p>

<div><p>""A better fitting boot can make a world of difference for skiers and snowboards. It can be the mean being able to stay out on the mountain longer without having to battle pressure points, added fatigue and cold feet. And finding that perfect fit starts with the solid foundation that Superfeet shape provides,"" says Matt Gooch, Superfeet VP of Product and Innovation. ""Our new winter insoles are comfort-driven, but also add stability and enhance edge control. The combination of improved comfort and performance is the key to enjoyment and improvement from first chair to après.""</p></div>
<h2>Why two insole choices for ski and snowboard boots?</h2>
<div>
<p>Not all boots fit the same. </p>
<p>Some snow sports enthusiasts prefer to wear roomier boots, often called a <em>comfort-fit</em>. If that’s you, choose <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/winter-support"">Superfeet Winter Support insoles</a> — they’re made with two layers of comfort foam for extra cushioning underfoot. </p>
<p>If you wear performance-fit boots that fit a little slimmer and have less wiggle room, you don’t have to sacrifice comfort.  <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/winter-support-thin"">Superfeet Winter Thin Support insoles</a> have a thinner profile, designed to fit well in a slimmer-fitting, performance-fit boot.</p>

<p>Keeping your feet feeling great is important for anyone, but when your job or your favorite activity depends on how well you can move around or stand for long periods of time, maintaining pain-free steps is especially vital. Athletes from rec leagues to pro stadiums and everyone from nurses to chefs to construction workers all know the effect foot pain can have on daily life. Choosing the right insole for your specific profession and foot need can make a world of difference for your feet.</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles not only help keep your feet feeling great until the last whistle or through the end of every shift, they also come in a variety of styles specifically designed for different use cases and types of footwear. Certified Pedorthist and Vice President of Product and Innovation at Superfeet, Matt Gooch, notes, “Whether you prefer structured support or a more cushioned feel under your feet, every Superfeet insole provides the support of our signature shape designed to perfectly match the anatomy of the foot,” turning any shoes into the most comfortable pair you own.</p>

<h2>Insoles for Athletes</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Many runners know the agony that conditions like shin splints and plantar fasciitis can cause, but sore and achy feet are never a welcome development for any athlete. Lower leg pain, joint pain and even back pain can also be attributed to the support (or lack thereof) under your feet. If you’re considering Superfeet products for reducing stress on the feet and joints, you’ve come to the right place. The <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"">signature Superfeet shape</a> not only gives the flat interior of most shoes a contoured shape reducing strain on your feet as you move, the support and stability provided by the structured arch and sculpted heel cup can provide relief to ankles, knees and back.</p>
<p>Just like there are a wide range of athletic activities, there are many Superfeet insoles for athletes and sports enthusiasts. Players wearing hockey skates need something different than players in soccer cleats, but they are united in their desire for support, stability, and comfort. Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-cushion"">Hockey Cushion</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-performance"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-performance"">Hockey Performance</a> insoles are specifically designed for skates while Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-low-arch"">Run Support Low Arch</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"">All-Purpose Support Low Arch</a> are thin enough to fit in tight-fitting shoes like cleats.</p>
<p>All Superfeet Run insoles work great for more than just the track or the trail. Run Support and Run Cushion insoles offer structured support and flexible cushion, respectively, and are designed for all athletic shoes. Whether you’re hitting jump shots, serving aces, or tossing a frisbee in the park – the support, stability, and cushioned comfort that Superfeet provide can help take your game to the next level.</p>

<h2>Insoles for Nurses and Healthcare Professionals</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We can all imagine the stress put on healthcare professionals, but unless you’ve lived the grueling hours, hectic activity, and demanding situations, it’s hard to truly know what it takes to be in that position. And even though healthcare workers might naturally be the most informed about staying healthy, it’s not always easy in practice. After all, the ironic sentiment that nurses take care of everyone except themselves didn’t come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>One simple upgrade that can have a big impact on your wellbeing every single day is giving your feet the right comfort and support. Even without all the other stressors factored in, just being on your feet all day can cause intense discomfort and pain. But it doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>There are a variety of premium Superfeet insoles for nurses and healthcare professionals who stand for extended periods. Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-support"">Casual Support</a> insoles offer the best of both worlds when it comes to comfort and support – a plush memory foam layer that extends the length of the foot combined with springy arch support reinforced with carbon fiber. Yes, the same incredibly strong yet ultralight material used in race cars and rocket ships!</p>
<p>Several Superfeet insoles are made with carbon fiber, including another great option for everyday and professional footwear: <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">Casual Pain Relief</a> insoles. Along with a form-fitting top cover that minimizes shifting as you move, these premium insoles come with an independent heel stabilizer that can be added inside your shoe for an even stronger foundation in every step. And, as the name implies, they’re a great option for anyone suffering from plantar fasciitis or other painful foot conditions.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more firm feeling arch support insoles for reducing stress on the feet and joints, Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"">All-Purpose Support High Arch</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"">Medium Arch</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-low-arch"">Low Arch</a> insoles offer durable support with a strong arch presence.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Insoles for Outdoor Professionals</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When it comes to outdoor professionals like construction workers and park rangers, shoes are more than footwear – they’re safety equipment. The boots worn in this industry offer plenty of rugged protection and durability. Comfort? Not so much. Which can make long days seem even longer and add foot pain to the list of injuries workers have to worry about.</p>
<p>A pair of Superfeet in your boots not only makes you feel better, but let’s you get more done without foot fatigue slowing you down. If you’re after insoles for reducing foot fatigue during high-impact activities, Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-high-impact-support"">All-Purpose High Impact Support</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-womens-high-impact-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-womens-high-impact-support"">All-Purpose Women’s High Impact Support</a> are great for people who are hard on their feet. The durable stabilizer cap keeps its shape through the toughest shifts for long-lasting arch support and extra forefoot cushioning provides resilient comfort under the balls of your feet.</p>
<p>Of course, Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"">Hike Cushion</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"">Hike Support</a> insoles are great options for anyone spending a lot of time outdoors. Specifically designed for hiking boots and other outdoor footwear, choose Hike Cushion for flexible comfort and Hike Support for springy arch support infused with carbon fiber.</p>
<p>Few could benefit more from pain-free feet and comfortable footwear than people who work long hours outdoors. That’s why Superfeet is proud to offer a variety of insoles for construction workers, mail carriers, and other outdoor professionals.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Choosing the Right Insole</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Ultimately, the right insole for your job or activity is the insole that feels the best to you. Many people who aren’t runners love Superfeet Run Cushion because of the flexible, lightly-structured support. Superfeet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"">All-Purpose</a> insoles are just that – well suited for many different use cases.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when picking an insole. One big deciding factor is between Support or Cushion. Are you looking for a softer, more flexible feel or structured shape under your feet? Each Superfeet insole has an underfoot cushioning rating from soft to firm making easier than ever to decide.</p>
<p>Another thing to think about is the arch height you’re looking for. While many Superfeet are great for all arch heights, Run and All-Purpose insoles offer high, medium, and low arch variations. The arch height and thickness are displayed below the name of each product. Thicker insoles are meant to replace the liner in roomier shoes while thin insoles can work in most footwear, even some without removable liners.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Get the Most out of Every Step</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Working on your feet or playing your favorite sport shouldn’t leave you aching and in pain. Most shoes are designed with exterior styling and construction in mind. That leaves a flat, unsupportive inside which your foot strains to accommodate. With Superfeet insoles in your shoes, your feet get contoured support and foam cushioning right where they need it, allowing you to get the most out of every step.</p>

<div><hr></div>
<div>
<p>I first heard about the <a href=""https://ultrarunning.com/features/destinations/grand-canyon-basics-rim-to-rim-to-rim/"">Rim 2 Rim 2 Rim (R2R2R)</a> a few years ago from a friend whose wife was planning to run it. It sounded beastly, which drew me in right away.</p>
<p>At the time, I was pregnant with our second child — so I decided to put this adventure on the calendar for the following year as a goal that I would try to accomplish when our youngest son would be about 15 months old.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the winter of 2020-21, when I began planning my training schedule to ensure that I would be more than prepared come October 2021, my planned timing for running the R2R2R. I was already running between 40 and 60 miles per week on average, but I knew that I would need to add in more strength training as well as vertical training to my current routine. During the ski season, I am at the mountain <a href=""https://www.girlswithgrit.fit/"">coaching and skiing</a> five to six days a week so although I continued to run throughout the winter months (on the treadmill, on the trails and at the track), I didn’t dive into my real training for the R2R2R until April when my trips to the mountain lessened.</p>
<p>To also ensure that I would get some long runs under my belt that were work related, I signed on as a guide for <a href=""https://evergreenexcursions.com/"">Evergreen Excursions</a> — more on that later.</p>
<p>When April hit, I revved up my training, making sure that I was at least hitting the trail two to three days a week (trail running and mountain biking), and hitting the track one day a week for speed work (speed work plays a HUGE role in long distance running).  I also added in three days of strength training, using 10 to 20 lb free weights at my house. Then, on April 24th, I rolled my ankle extremely badly — which ended up sidelining me for a few weeks. As soon as I could, I began mountain biking, then slowly (while listening to my body) began hiking, then jogging, then running again.</p>
<p>With my other coaching beginning in late spring and early summer (trail running, River SUP &amp; mountain biking), I began to spread out my cross-training to include <a href=""https://www.girlswithgrit.fit/stand-up-paddle-boarding"">River Stand Up Paddle Boarding</a> and even more mountain biking to keep my ankle happy as I continued to build all of my strength back. One of my first big runs back after my ankle injury was my first trail running excursion that I guided of the summer in the beginning of August — it was <a href=""https://evergreenexcursions.com/rosslake/"">20 miles at Ross Lake</a> with a low elevation profile. I was stoked to finish that day feeling great, and like I hadn’t even run far at all.</p>
<p>Just a week later, my next two big training runs hit. They were back-to-back 20-mile runs — with more than 9400 feet of vertical over the entire 40 miles. And when I felt GREAT after these two days in the mountains, I knew that my training was on point for my 40-miler coming up in September. One of the things to keep in mind when training for ultras is to always check in with yourself after long or even just “difficult” runs. By making time to listen to your body, REALLY listen to it, you can gauge if your training is not enough, if it’s too much or if it is pretty spot on.</p>
<p>As I continued my training into September, I did one more hefty training one with high vert before I slowed WAY down a week prior to my 40-miler to ensure that I would be rested and ready for the next excursion I would be guiding in the North Cascades. Lots of food, water and a ton of positive energy and stoke got our crew through that day, which ended up being about 42 miles and over 9000 ft of vert. And when I felt stellar post-run that evening, I knew I would be more than prepared for our R2R2R which was set to happen just one month later.</p>
<p>And throughout ALL of this training, I was eating… A LOT. My main focus for calories were protein and fats, because those are what I lack most in my everyday cravings. I cannot push this enough — you must eat enough calories to keep your muscle and not lose it when you are training, no matter the distance. The biggest problem that my clients have with weight management and with training is that they don’t eat enough.<br><br>Since my husband, Andy, and I hadn’t been on a trip together that wasn’t work related since prior to having our first child (who is now 5 1/2), I decided to make the R2R2R just one day of adventure among a 10 day road trip. Andy and I dirt biked in Fort Valley for the two days prior to my run, and I even got the chance to go for a run on the beautiful <a href=""https://aztrail.org/"">Arizona Trail</a>. (P.S. Flagstaff is RAD!).</p>

<p><br>Then the day came to conquer the mighty beast that is the R2R2R! <br><br>With my friends, Mary and Solveig, we started at the South Kaibab Trailhead as we descended down into the canyon in the dark. The sun came up as we made it to the mighty Colorado and passed Phantom Ranch, and we got to wind our way through the canyon with perfect temps, cheering on everyone we met along the way. The ascent up the North Rim was difficult, but absolutely stunning, and SO different from the South Rim! A quick sock change, water fill and sandwich break and we were off again, making our way back the way we had come. We continued spreading the stoke the entire way back to the South Rim, even when the temps increased and the hours on our feet began to come to our attention. Once we made it back to Phantom Ranch, we took the Bright Angel trail turn-off to begin our final eight mile ascent to get ourselves back to the top of the South Rim. When we were just a few miles from the top, darkness descended upon us — but that didn’t stop the three of us from pushing on, stoked to be so close to accomplishing our goal.</p>
<p>The day after our run, I felt great — my legs weren’t even sore. But, I did eat like a horse for at least a week!</p>

<div><div>
<div>
<p>Many top athletes dedicate their lives to their sport, training both their body and mind.</p>
<p>Although they push their bodies to the limit, nutrition plays an imperative role in their success. The food they consume influences strength, performance, training, and recovery. Here's an inside look into how (and what) elite athlete eat.</p>
</div>
<h3>Eating Like a High Performance Athlete is No Joke</h3>
<div>
<p>In 2008, Michael Phelps' diet was all the craze. Consuming as many as 12,000 calories during training days and before his races, the public was in awe of his dietary intake. Allegedly the athlete would consume three fried egg sandwiches, a stack of chocolate chip pancakes, a five-egg omelet, French toast, and grits for breakfast. Not to mention the two pounds of pasta he'd eat each day.</p>
<p>Of course, for the vast majority of athletes, Phelps' diet is beyond overkill. However, it is a clear depiction of eating based on your needs. When you're training, you need fuel.</p>
</div>
<h2>Here's how to eat like an elite athlete</h2>
<div><p>The following recommendations will help any athlete eat and hydrate like a high-performance athlete. Tweak the suggestions below to meet your needs.</p></div>
<h3>Plan your meals, preparing for 2-3 days in advance</h3>
<div>
<p>Training all the time means that it's easy to fall into unhealthy habits where convenience trumps nutrition. That is why it's so important to plan. Before you go grocery shopping, make a list of foods that cover all of your nutritional needs — and stick to it.</p>
<p>Depending on how many calories you consume daily and your specific needs, you should get:</p>
<p>•    50-60% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables</p>
<p>•    15-25% of your daily calories from lean proteins, such as beans, poultry, and fish</p>
<p>•    20-30% of your daily calories from high-quality fats, such as nuts, avocados, seeds, nut butters, and olive oil</p>
</div>
<h3>Never skip breakfast and eat frequently</h3>
<div>
<p>Performance athletes typically eat within 30 to 60 minutes after they wake up, always opting for a source of quality, lean protein. Build your power breakfast from ingredients like steel-cut oatmeal, quinoa, turkey sausage, eggs, and organic dairy.</p>
<p>Once you've polished off your breakfast, fuel up every four hours at the very least. This will provide you with the sustainable energy you need to train while minimizing your risk of injury. Once again, eat protein at regular intervals throughout the day to ensure optimal muscle repair and growth.</p>
</div>
<h3>Eat based on your sport</h3>
<div><p>Depending on your sport, your nutritional needs will differ. For example, if you're an endurance runner, you will need a higher carbohydrate intake compared to powerlifters, who require slightly higher protein needs. Starchy vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruit are all excellent sources of carbs, providing you with the energy you need to train for hours.</p></div>
<h3>Hydrate often</h3>
<div><p>To get the most out of your training and recovery, you need to develop a hydration plan. Consider the intensity, duration, and frequency of training, as well as your fitness level and environmental conditions. Research shows that as little as 2-3% weight loss from sweat can negatively affect your performance. Although water should be consumed throughout the day and during training, if your training session is over 60-90 minutes, replenish your electrolytes with a low sugar sports drink.</p></div>
<h3>Preparing for a big event</h3>
<div><p>Performance athletes, and their coaches, have a good understanding of the value nutrition brings to their training. Switch to food as fuel mentality, especially in advance of a major competition or race.</p></div>
<div><p>After all, Jack LaLanne hit the nail on the head when he said, ""Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. Put them together, and you've got a kingdom.""</p></div>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>The term <em>Achilles heel</em> refers to a person's greatest weakness. According to legend, Achilles's mother dipped him in the river Styx, which made him invulnerable except for the spot his mother held him by — his heel. This myth seems to have some truth to it since humans are vulnerable to Achilles heel damage. Achilles Tendonitis can strike people of all ages, causing pain and limited mobility.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Achilles Tendonitis?</h2>
<div>
<p>Your Achilles tendon runs down the back of your leg and attaches your calf muscle to your heel. Anytime you walk, run or otherwise use your feet, you rely on your Achilles tendons. When a tendon is injured and inflamed, your daily activities are seriously compromised. You can suffer from two types of Achilles Tendonitis: noninsertional and insertional. Noninsertional tendonitis means that the middle of your tendon has small tears and has begun to swell. According to experts, this type of Achilles Tendonitis commonly affects younger people who are physically active. Insertional tendonitis can affect people of all ages, although it often results from years of stress and strain. This condition occurs where the heel and the tendon attach, and it can lead to inflammation, calcified fibers and bone spurs.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of Achilles Tendonitis</h2>
<div>
<p>If you have Achilles tendonitis, you may notice pain near or above your heel after you've been active. Stair climbing and running may become difficult. Also, you might find the area stiff and sore when you wake up in the morning. Your heel may feel better after you engage in moderate movement. You may also experience tight calf muscles and a ""warm"" heel. If the pain continues or becomes severe, you should visit your medical professional. You could have a ruptured tendon.</p>
</div>

<h2>Causes of Achilles Tendonitis</h2>
<div>
<p>An abrupt increase in exercise can cause injury to the Achilles tendon. You decide to begin running five miles a day instead of three, the sudden change can cause tears in the tendon. Also, weekend sports warriors may develop this condition as they age. The bursts of activity after a relatively sedentary week can injure the muscle fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2>Treatments for Achilles Tendonitis</h2>
<div>
<p>This condition can benefit from the tried-and-true RICE method: rest, ice, compression and elevation. Your doctor may have you limit your activities until the inflammation dissipates. If your tendon has ruptured, the doctor may recommend surgery to reattach the tendon.</p>

<p>Runners are a special breed of athletes. To simply run for an extended period of time takes a certain kind of person willing to invest the energy to push their body to the next level. The reward, however, the runner’s high as it is known, is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of the sport of running, be it trail or road running, is that it does not require a lot of gear. Your running shoes are the primary piece of equipment you need.</p>
<p>But the benefits of putting insoles into those running shoes? Priceless.</p>
<p>The shoe may be the vehicle that gets you from point A to point B, but your running insoles are the interior of that vehicle that lets you do it in comfort and style – like a premium bucket seat for your feet inside your running shoes.</p>
<p>Running insoles can improve comfort, performance, and even help prevent and relieve some common foot ailments. That’s why Superfeet can be found in the shoes of runners worldwide, from couch-to-5K casual runners to seasoned marathoners and professional athletes.</p>

<h2>What makes Superfeet insoles for running different from the competitors?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We know there is more to feet than arch height. Every runner is unique, with their own needs and preferences. That’s why Superfeet makes a wide range of insole styles to fit every runner. Whether you like the feel of a structured orthotic or prefer to wear a cushioned insole that feels like part of your shoe, there is a <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">Superfeet running insole</a> to make your next run a little less painful and a lot more fun.</p>
<p>No matter which Superfeet insert you choose for your running shoes, you’ll get to experience the proven benefits of signature Superfeet shape. Trusted by runners and worn and recommended by medical professionals since 1977, the orthotic shape of Superfeet is built with three key elements that combine to give your feet and body comfort and support where you need it most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rearfoot support: The contoured arch shape in Superfeet is felt further back than what you might be used to from a more traditional arch support. Based on proven principles of podiatric science, this placement is intentional, designed to enhance the way your feet are intended to move, dispersing impact and decreasing stress and strain on your entire body.</li>
<li>Structured heel cup: The design of the Superfeet heel cup helps take the soft tissue already under your heel bones and cradles it together to make your own personal heel cushion, helping maximize your body’s natural shock absorption.</li>
<li>Energizing foundation: Designed to be durable and withstand your hardest runs, all Superfeet insoles are built with an energizing, reinforced foundation. Like the perfect mattress, the combination of comfort foam with the base of stabilizing support help your feet feel as good at the end of your run as they do at the start.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>What are the differences between Superfeet Run Support and Run Cushion insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Superfeet has two distinct product lines within our family of <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">running-specific insoles</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run Support — These running insoles are built with a responsive EVOLyte stabilizer cap, giving them a structured and stable feel. The combination of the cap and cushioned foams in these Superfeet running insoles deliver exceptional comfort and smooth, efficient energy transfer through your gait, from foot strike to toe-off. These insoles for running deliver a more stable, supportive feel under the foot. It offers what we like to call a higher “dose” of Superfeet shape – you can feel more of the insole contours under your feet when they are in your shoes. If you want more support and maximum responsiveness from your runs, then look no further.</li>
<li>Run Cushion — These insoles maximize your step-in comfort by offering a luxurious, cushioning-first ride for your run. They help reduce foot fatigue, have a minimal break-in period, and deliver a lower “dose” of Superfeet shape. If you are all about comfort and cushion or are brand new to wearing insoles, Superfeet insoles featuring Adaptive Comfort Technology are for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both product lines are built with the signature Superfeet orthotic shape, made to deliver exceptional comfort and the seamless transfer of energy throughout your foot on each step. At Superfeet, comfort is king (not just a saying – that notion is backed <a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"" title=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/20/1290"">by science</a>).</p>
<p>So, regardless of the technology and features, it really comes down to what feels the best under your specific foot.</p>
<p>The main differences between the Run Support and Run Cushion insoles revolve around your personal preferences and history with insoles. Let’s take a closer look at the features and benefits of the individual insoles within these product families:</p>

<h2>What makes Superfeet insoles for hiking different from the competitors?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We know there is more to choosing an insole than just your arch height. Every hiker is unique, with their own needs and preferences. That’s why Superfeet offers different styles of insoles to meet the needs of all types of hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. Whether you like the feel of a structured orthotic or prefer to wear a cushioned insole that feels like it is built right into your hiking boots, there is a Superfeet hiking insole to make your next adventure a lot more enjoyable.</p>
<p>No matter which Superfeet hiking insole you choose for your boots, you’ll experience the proven benefits of signature Superfeet shape. Celebrated by outdoor enthusiasts and worn and recommended by medical professionals since 1977, the orthotic shape of Superfeet is built with three key elements that combine to give your feet and body comfort and support where you need it most, even on your longest, toughest outdoor adventure.</p>
<p>Some of the main features Superfeet hiking insoles offer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rearfoot support:</strong> The contoured arch shape in Superfeet is felt further back than what you might be used to from a more traditional arch support. Based on proven principles of podiatric science, this placement is intentional, designed to enhance the way your feet are intended to move, dispersing impact and decreasing stress and strain on your entire body.</li>

<strong>Structured heel cup:</strong> The design of the Superfeet heel cup helps take the soft tissue already under your heel bones and cradles it together to make your own personal heel cushion, helping maximize your body’s natural shock absorption</li>
<li>
<strong>Energizing foundation:</strong> Designed to be durable and withstand your hardest runs, all Superfeet insoles are built with an energizing, reinforced foundation.

<h2>What is the difference between Superfeet Hike Support Insoles for Hiking and Superfeet Hike Cushion Insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Odds are when you are five miles into a backpacking trip, the last thing you are thinking about is the insoles in your boots. At least that is the hope. By putting in the time and energy in advance to find the insoles that work best for your feet, you will be able to forget about them on the trail and focus on reaching the next pass or mountain summit.</p>
<p>The Hike Cushion and Hike Support are two lines that Superfeet offers for hikers looking to reach the next level on the trail. There are advantages to each, including having top-of-the-line materials to enhance their purpose as well as the shapes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the mechanics of each type of insole, and the type of hikers that can benefit the most from each line.</p>
<p>The main differences in each of these lines revolve around the individual hikers’ personal preferences and history with insoles. This speaks to the adaptive, or soft, to responsive or firm, spectrum in which your preferences lie. Do you want a firm, more present insole or a more cushioned, softer footbed?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-cushion"">HIKE CUSHION</a>: For the latter option, these insoles provide maximum step-in comfort. They also reduce foot fatigue and have a minimal break-in period. Think of this as a lower dose of Superfeet shape.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-support"">HIKE SUPPORT</a> and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-womens-support"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hike-womens-support"">HIKE WOMEN'S SUPPORT</a>: Inversely, these insoles deliver a more stable, supportive feel under the foot. If you want a “higher dose” of Superfeet shape in your boot, then these are the insoles for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Superfeet insoles are built to deliver exceptional comfort and smooth and efficient energy transfer through your gait from foot strike to toe-off in each step. Trail-specific insoles stabilize your feet on uneven ground and enhance comfort, even on the roughest terrain.</p>

Designed with Adaptive Comfort Technology, these comfortable orthotics for hiking flex and adapt to your foot's natural motion. These are great for someone new to wearing an aftermarket insole or someone looking to replace the stock insoles in their boot to add some additional cushioning.</p>
<p><strong>Hike Cushion Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive Comfort Technology (A.C.T.)<br>
<ul>
<li>When traversing a rocky trail, your foot moves every which way. It’s not flat like a sidewalk. That’s why this technology is designed to flex with you as you traverse those epic trails. These hiking insoles adapt your footwear to the way your feet move, so wherever your foot goes, your insole is there to provide comfort and support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Energizing Heel Cushion</li>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of the terrain, hiking is hard. After long miles on the trail, your heel is going to take a bit of a beating. This technology knows that and disperses the impact while reducing vibration to minimize fatigue. Basically, the longer you hike the more this feature will make you feel fantastic on the trail.</li>
</ul>
<li>Responsive Forefoot Zone</li>
<ul>
<li>Hikers get in the zone when they are deep in the wilderness. We want your insoles to do the same thing. That’s why this responsive forefoot zone adroitly blends cushioning and rebound to add a spring to every step. This insole zone keeps you in the hiking zone.</li>
</ul>
<li>Aerolyte Dual Comfort Layer</li>
<ul>
<li>This sounds fancy and technical, but basically, it means that the base of the insole supports the rear foot. At the same time, it provides structure and stability to the foam layer. This transfers to a more comfortable and secure hike.</li>

<h2>Can insoles help with plantar fasciitis and other foot pain while hiking?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you have suffered injuries or foot and leg pain in the past, having a more firm insole, or a higher dose of Superfeet insoles, can help. The Superfeet shape can reduce foot fatigue and help resolve common foot and lower leg injuries.</p>
<p>Hiking with plantar fasciitis is no fun. If you suffer from heel pain after hiking, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/shin-splints-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/shin-splints-explained"">shin splints</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/health-wellness/relief-from-common-anterior-knee-pain"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/health-wellness/relief-from-common-anterior-knee-pain"">patellofemoral pain syndrome</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/achilles-tendonitis-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/achilles-tendonitis-explained"">Achilles tendonitis</a>, and <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/it-band-syndrome-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/it-band-syndrome-explained"">IT band syndrome</a>, you can benefit from a strong Superfeet insole shape.</p>

<li>Arch Shape - made to stabilize the foot on rough terrain, reducing stress on feet, ankles, knees, and back</li>
<li>Durability - Superfeet insoles keep their shape, delivering reliable support and comfort for up to 12 months or 500 miles, whichever comes first</li>
<li>Moisturewick™ technology - long-lasting odor control and moisture management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the best insoles for hiking boots are the ones that are comfortable for you. Superfeet believes that comfort is king, and you should settle for nothing less when hiking on the trail.</p>

<div>
<p>Plantar fasciitis (PF) is what I often refer to as a nuisance injury. At first, it’s rarely painful enough to stop someone in their tracks. But, it can just keep hanging on and gradually worsen over time until it becomes debilitating. <br><br>Many times very simple treatments go a long way not only in resolving PF but also in preventing recurrence. Fortunately, 80-90% of people can resolve their symptoms by doing some exercises and supporting the arch with insoles (i).</p>
</div>
<h2>Common Causes of Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<div>
<p>The plantar fascia is a ligament that originates at the bottom of the calcaneus (heel bone) and extends to the bases of the phalangeal bones of the toes. The plantar fascia is the most important non-muscular structure that supports and stabilizes the arch. <br><br>The plantar fascia is under strain when we are standing flat footed but also subjected to even higher strain when our heel lifts and transfers weight to the forefoot in gait. If the plantar fascia is subjected to excessive or repetitive strain it will become injured. It is important to understand that load is highest on the plantar fascia not when the heel hits the ground, but while the heel is raising. For the vast majority who suffer from it, PF is strain problem, not an impact problem — that is why heel cushioning rarely helps.</p>
<p>Most people take between 8,000-10,000 steps each day just for everyday activities. Walkers take roughly 2,000 steps per mile while runners take 1,000-1,500. For a number of reasons these steps can also begin to overload the plantar fascia and cause strain.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who Can Get Plantar Fasciitis?</h2>
<div>
<p>PF is a unique injury in that it commonly affects young athletes but just as commonly affects older sedentary individuals, and almost anyone in between. Risk factors for plantar fasciitis include: obesity, limited ankle range-of motion, increasing activity, jobs that require long periods of weight bearing activity and improper footwear. For some, there are no easily identifiable causative factors.</p>
<p>There are many theories about why PF is so common. Some speculate that it is due to weakened foot muscles from wearing shoes. Others point to the artificially hard and flat surfaces such as concrete and asphalt which are more common than ever before.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<div>
<p>The most common complaint or symptom of plantar fasciitis is heel pain, especially after arising from bed or sitting. Pain usually improves gradually with walking only to return again later. Runners often state that they have no pain during their workout.</p>
<p>Variations of PF pain include pain that radiates into the arch, and pain that worsens as the day progresses. PF does not cause ankle, lower leg or forefoot pain but because PF is so common, many individuals misdiagnose themselves with this condition. X-rays may show a bone spur but this does not often affect the prognosis or treatment.</p>
</div>
<h2>Best Insoles for Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<div>
<p>Those suffering with PF often ask which shoe or insole is “best for plantar fasciitis?” Of course, there is not one single magical shoe or insole that cures plantar fasciitis for all.</p>
<p>Start with footwear: focus on finding comfortable footwear. Insoles work great for those who are already in an appropriate shoe. I recommend insoles be selected based on comfort but emphasize that <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">firm insoles</a> relieve tension on the fascia better than cushioned insoles.</p>
</div>
<h2>Stretching Exercises for Plantar Fasciitis Relief</h2>
<div style=""text-align: start;"">
<p>Stretching exercises that isolate the arch and calf have been shown to help reduce pain of PF (iii).</p>
<h3>Calf Stretch (and Strengthener)</h3>
<p>Calf stretches can be done by extending one leg behind you. While keeping both feet flat on the ground, point the toes straight ahead and lean forward, using a wall or tree for balance until tension is felt in the calf muscles. This should be held for 30 seconds and repeated three times with the knee straight and then three times with the knee slightly bent. Adding in calf strengthening exercises (good to do whether you are injured or not) like heel raises not only strengthen but also improve flexibility.</p>
<h3>Seated Plantar Fasciitis Stretch</h3>
<p><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Planter_Faciitis_Stretchs-Blog_Plantar_Fascia_Stretch.jpg"" alt=""Diagram on how to do a seated plantar fasciitis stretch."" style=""float: none;""></picture></p>
<p>Plantar fascia stretches can be done from a seated position by crossing the leg and resting the foot to be stretched on the opposite knee. Next, pull the toes back until tension is felt in arch and/or heel. Hold stretch for 10 seconds while massaging the tender and/or tight area of the plantar fascia with the opposite hand. Repeat 10 times. Do one set of 10, three times each day.</p>
</div>
<h2>Intrinsic Muscle Strengthening Exercises for Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<div style=""text-align: start;"">
<p>It is only recently that we have started to appreciate the importance of the intrinsic muscles (IMs) of the foot. IMs describe the small muscles the originate in the feet and provide stability and support. A theory proposed in 2014 equated the IMs of the feet to the core muscles of the pelvis. Just as inhibition and weakness of the pelvic stabilizing core muscles can contribute to low back, knee and hip pain, the authors proposed that inhibition and weakness of the IMs can contribute to foot and ankle pain. Keep in mind that this theory that has not been fully validated. But, for those who treat foot and ankle injuries, it makes sense that having strong intrinsic muscles is an important part of not only treating injuries but also preventing them.</p>
<p>Note: muscles can not only become weak but they can also become inhibited, meaning the muscles may have adequate strength but are poorly activated so they do not fire properly. Your feet touch the ground for about a second when walking and less than half a second when running so any delay in firing can contribute to problems. <br><br>For those who are experiencing plantar fasciitis, the following exercises can be done daily to help strengthen the IMs until pain free, and then 2-3 times per week for maintenance:</p>
<h3>Toe Yoga<br><br><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Planter_Faciitis_Stretchs_Blog_Toe_Yoga.jpg"" alt=""Diagrams on how to do toe yoga."" style=""float: none;""></picture>
</h3>
<p>Intrinsic muscles can be activated by doing “Toe Yoga”. Begin by standing barefoot, press the big toe into the ground while raising the lesser toes. Hold for 2-3 seconds then repeat 10 times. Then do the opposite. Press the small toes into the ground while raising the big toe. Do this daily. For some, it is difficult to do at first and then becomes much easier as the muscles become more activated. You should not see any movement in the ankles or knees when you do this. The only movement should be in the toes and arch.</p>
<h3>Short Foot Exercise<br><br><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Planter_Faciitis_Stretchs-Blog_Short_Foot.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of how to do the short foot exercise."" style=""float: none;""></picture>
</h3>
<p>The “short foot” exercise is another method to activate and strengthen the IMs. Place the foot flat on the ground and pull the toes back towards the heel without curling the toes up or down. Essentially you are making the foot shorter by contracting the muscles that raise the arch and pull the forefoot closer to the heel. This exercise should be done from a seated position first and then once it becomes easy should be done weightbearing. This exercise can be done either barefoot or in shoes and can be done randomly throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Ball Pick-Up</h3>
<p><picture> <source> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/Planter_Faciitis_Stretchs-Blog_ToeBall.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of how to do the ball pick up exercise."" style=""float: none;""></picture></p>
<p>A more playful way to activate and strengthen the IMs along with the EMs is to spend 1 to 5 minutes using your toes to pick up a small, soft ball.</p>
<p>For approximately 20-50% of people PF can recur so they need to make note of which exercises and insoles work best for them and employ them when symptoms flare.</p>
<p>Like most overuse injuries, the longer PF persists the more difficult it to resolve so recognizing it and treating it is best done sooner than later.</p>

<div>
<p>Forty years ago, Superfeet introduced an insole that offered structured support with a <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"">science-backed shape</a> contoured to the biomechanics of the human foot. That insole, simply called GREEN, became legendary for its durable, long-lasting support. <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch"">Superfeet GREEN</a>, still one of the most popular Superfeet insoles, has been joined by many others tailored to specific activities and types of footwear that also offer a wider range of cushioning and flexibility.</p>
<p>In the spirit of innovation that has guided Superfeet since its founding, we are giving the same great products known worldwide for providing comfort and support brand new names<strong> </strong>to better reflect the purpose and feel of each insole. We are also refreshing the packaging with an updated design that showcases what makes Superfeet different and clearly indicates important information like arch height, thickness, and cushioning feel.</p>
<p>The name changes and packaging updates simplify the Superfeet insole selection process so you can quickly and easily understand how each Superfeet product will meet your unique needs.</p>
<p>""For those who know and love Superfeet, our GREEN insole is synonymous with firm support and recognizable simply by its color name, but we know this naming convention doesn’t explain what the insole provides, and the many benefits wearers can experience,” says Trip Randall, CEO at Superfeet. “We want to support as many feet as possible, and we’re confident that simplifying the insole discovery process with more descriptive names and updated packaging is a big step towards achieving that goal.”</p>
<p>The updated and more descriptive naming convention spans across the entire product lineup, providing consistency and easy differentiation between styles. You can count on the same trusted insole design and performance as each style maintains the signature orthotic shape Superfeet is known for. The all-new names feature the activity directly in the name—all-purpose, run, hike, hockey, winter, casual—and include the primary benefit each insole will deliver—support, cushion, performance.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>How to find the right insole for you</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>It’s never been easier to find the perfect Superfeet insoles that match your feet and footwear. First, think about how you’ll use your Superfeet. Are you looking for more cushion in your hiking boots or do you want better performance out of your hockey skates? Maybe you want to add arch support to your casual everyday shoes or need long-lasting support for a variety of activities?</p>
<p>Look to the first part of each new name to indicate what each insole is designed for, whether it be <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"">Hike</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">Run</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/all-purpose"">All-Purpose</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"">Hockey</a>, etc. The next part of each name points to the underfoot feel – Support (durable arch support and presence under the foot) or Cushion (flexible support that feels like it’s built into your shoes). Look for a cushioning scale on each product page that illustrates from soft to firm how each insoles feels as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, some insoles specify whether they are designed with a Low, Medium, or High Arch height right in the name, like<a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-medium-arch""> All-Purpose Support Medium Arch</a> or <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-high-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-cushion-high-arch"">Run Cushion High Arch. </a></p>
<p>In addition to the new names, each insole now comes with a thickness indicator. Insoles with a MAX thickness work best replacing the removable liner in roomy shoes and boots while insoles with a THIN thickness can fit in slim-fitting footwear, even some without removable liners.</p>

<p>Easily one of the best ways to spend a long weekend, regardless of the time of year, is trekking a trail over rocky mountain passes, along breezy coastlines, or in deep, verdant woodlands. Whether you make plans to revisit an old favorite or knock a new one off your bucket list, backpacking always presents a memorable adventure.</p>
<p>From Southeastern classics like Roan Mountain, to New England treasures like a hut-to-hut trip in the Presidentials, to epic and challenging trails in the Tetons, here are some of America's greatest backpacking trips.</p>
<h2>1. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</h2>
<p><em>19 miles, 1-2 days, Easy</em></p>
<h6>The view of Grand Portal Point from a distance (along the North Country Trail). <small> Rachel Kramer </small>
</h6>
<p>Situated in the upper Midwest, the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a see-it-to-believe-it sort of landscape with towering sandstone cliffs, impossibly blue lake waters, waterfalls, beaches, and dense woodlands. It also happens to be home to a 42-mile section of the 4,600 mile <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/noco"">North Country National Scenic Trail</a> along the south shore of Lake Superior, stretching from Munising, MI, to Grand Marais, MN.</p>
<p>Backcountry camping is available at 14 campgrounds along this 71,400-acre linear park. In the winter, under the right conditions, mammoth ice caves form, attracting thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>The 4.4 miles of the lakeshore path between the Mosquito and Chapel rivers is the most popular section of the North Country Trail. It follows the cliffs through deciduous forest and over sandy sections within view of Grand Portal Point and Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Most hikers start and end their day hikes at Grand Sable Visitor Center on the north end. Further south, the Coves Group to Munising Falls is an ambitious 19.2-mile trek. Yet another option is to start at Munising Falls at the southern end and take a ferry to Grand Island National Recreation Area. A popular marathon and 50K is run around the perimeter of the island in July, switching from clockwise to counter-clockwise year to year.</p>
<h2>2. Superior Hiking Trail</h2>
<p><em>18 miles, 1-2 days, Moderate</em></p>
<h6>Taking in the views of Lake Superior <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kahtava/"">Adam Kahtava</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/minneapolis-mn/backpacking-camping/superior-hiking-trail"">Superior Hiking Trail</a> is a 310-mile long footpath in northeastern Minnesota that follows the ridgeline on the North Coast of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Most accessible is the 40-mile southernmost section through Jay Cooke State Park to the northern boundary of the city of Duluth. There are no campsites there, and due to flood damage in 2012, parts of this section remain diverted.</p>
<p>To the north, however, is the 18-mile stretch from Silver Bay to Country Road 6 where views of the Big Lake and smaller glacier-scoured lakes are frequently in view through the birch and maple canopy. The colors peak in late September and early October, if you can time your trek then. (Avoid the trail in May and early June, when the clouds of mosquitoes and black flies at their thickest.)</p>
<p>This section of the SHT includes a short but steep climb up Mount Trudee to a 30-foot waterfall on the Baptism River. If you don't catch a glimpse of the deer, wolves, or mountain lions known to inhabit the region (don't worry; they're more afraid of you than you are of them), you may still see their tracks.</p>
<p>Rockier and more technical sections of the SHT are favored by the <a href=""http://www.superiortrailrace.com/"">trail runners who race</a> out of Lutsen, MN, in May (25K and 50K) and September (26.2, 50 and 100 miles).</p>
<h2>3. Roan Mountain Highlands</h2>
<p><em>14 miles, 1-2 days, Difficult</em></p>
<h6>The views from these ethereal highlands are stunning and constant, and bring to mind visions of Scotland and Wales. <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/28744394@N08/"">Joe Giordano</a> </small>
</h6>
<p><a href=""https://rootsrated.com/charlotte-nc/backpacking-camping/roan-mountain-backpacking2"">Roan Mountain</a> is a 20-mile massif that lies along the Tennessee-North Carolina border. It consists of five sub-peaks, and is divided into two sections by Carvers Gap. To the west of Carvers Gap are Roan High Bluff and Roan High Knob, with Tollhouse Gap and Rhododendron Gardens lying between the two peaks.</p>
<p>A 14-mile section of the Appalachian Trail traverses the Roan Mountain between Carvers Gap and Highway 19E along the northern border of TN and NC. Heading south from 19E, plan to hike 8 miles to the Overmountain Shelter, a.k.a. “The Barn.” Stay inside with other backpackers or pitch your tent in its vicinity. Either way, you’ll be waking to a spectacular sunrise over the valley.</p>
<p>Pack up and trek the final tough 5 miles over three balds. As you approach Carvers Gap, you'll cross Grassy Ridge, the longest stretch of grassy bald in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<h2>4. Grayson Highlands State Park</h2>
<p><em>7 miles, copious bouldering, 1-2 days, Moderate to Difficult</em></p>
<h6>Camping among the rhododendrons in Virginia's Grayson Highlands <small> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jakeewheeler/"">Jake Wheeler</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>Within southwestern VA lies the Jefferson National Forest. And within the forest lies <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/asheville-nc/backpacking-camping/grayson-highlands-state-park"">Grayson Highlands State Park</a> , a gateway to Mount Rogers and to a number of miles along the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>To summit Mount Rogers, the state’s highest peak at 5, 729 feet, there’s a 6.7-mile Mount Rogers National Recreation Trail from the Grindstone Campground six miles east of Troutdale. Or take the scenic 2.3-mile Wilburn Ridge Trail from the state park. There are no views from the forested peak, but on either route you’re likely to encounter wild ponies and clusters of exposed and inviting boulders.</p>
<p>In fact, both AT thru hikers and day visitors would do well to check out the bouldering scene in the Grayson Highlands. The Listening Rock Trail offers the most bouldering opportunities, followed by the AVP and Boneyard areas. Climbers take in beautiful top-outs, especially after conquering the Highland Highball, in the Highlands Bouldering Area.</p>
<p>Backcountry camping is not allowed within Grayson Highlands State Park, but camping is allowed in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area (MRNRA). Hikers traveling north on the AT exit the park when they cross Big Wilson Creek. You’re welcome to camp across the creek, just past the Wise Shelter fence.</p>

<h2>5. Standing Indian, NC</h2>
<p><em>24-mile loop, 1-2 nights, Moderate</em></p>
<h6>The Standing Indian Shelter <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcd/"">McDowell Crook</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>A two-night stay is recommended to fully take in the Standing Indian Loop in NC’s Nantahala National Forest. Fifteen miles of the 24-mile <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/4-awesome-and-inexpensive-spring-break-trips-in-the-southeast"">Standing Indian Loop</a> is on the Appalachian Trail, but all of it showcases the Nantahalas’ most impressive and beautiful features.</p>
<p>Knowing you start the trek at 4,000 feet makes the multiple 5,000-foot peaks a little less intimidating. For the AT, the Standing Indian trip is a moderate hike. All the better, as the views along the way are some of the most stunning you'll find in the Smokies.</p>
<p>From the Standing Indian Campground, travel up the Long Branch Trail until it connects with the AT. Mt. Albert is only 5.5 miles from the trailhead, but plan to spend your first night at the summit. In the morning, drink in the panoramic view before descending to Carter Cap, where there's a shelter and water. Expect to spend most of the day walking along a ridge with sweeping views.</p>
<p>Gradually you’ll make your way to the treeless and spectacular peak of Standing Indian itself. There is one small campsite on this bald, so if you want to snag it, you'll need to begin your second day very early in the morning.</p>
<p>On your final day, head back down to the Standing Indian Campground on the 7-mile Kimsey Creek Trail through dense hemlock groves and rhododendron tunnels. Keep in mind that in the early spring months, you’re likely to find snow and ice on this side of the mountain.</p>
<h2>6. The Long Trail</h2>
<p><em>23 miles, 2 days, Difficult</em></p>
<h6>Some of the views you'll find along the Long Trail in Vermont <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/49287570@N06/"">Nate Merrill</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The Long Trail, the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America, is a 272-mile footpath that follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont stateline to the Canadian border. The Long Trail stretches the length of Vermont and crosses the state’s highest peaks.</p>
<p>It can take nearly three weeks to thru-hike the Long Trail and the 53 mountains (27 of which are 3,500 feet or higher) along it. It can be tackled section by section, too.</p>
<p>One of the toughest sections, the 23 miles from Birch Glen Camp northwest to the Buchanan Shelter, includes 8,000 feet of climbing and descending—including 1,700 feet at a 17 percent grade to the summit of <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/an-insiders-guide-to-hiking-camels-hump"">Camels Hump</a>. The exposed scramble over rock slabs pays off with views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks to the west, Mount Washington to the east, and <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/stories/mount-mansfield-man-moose-legend-ap"">Mount Mansfield</a> to the north.</p>
<p>The descent along the ridgeline bottoms out with a 3.6-mile hike to the outskirts of Jonesville, VT. Stay overnight at the Duckbrook Shelter or wait to camp on the western slopes of Bolton Mountain at the Buchanan Shelter. There are six shelters along this stretch, thanks to the Green Mountain Club which built the trail between 1910 and 1930 and maintains it to this day.</p>
<h2>7. Presidential Traverse, NH</h2>
<p><em>23 miles, 1-2 days, Difficult to Moderate</em></p>
<h6>Overlooking the White Mountains of New Hampshire after a strenuous climb <small> Ry Glover </small>
</h6>
<p>The Presidential Traverse in the White Mountains of New Hampshire is nearly 23 miles long with close to 9,000 feet of elevation gain. Best hiked from north to south, to bag the highest of 10 peaks first, the traverse demands a dawn-to-dusk effort if you don’t have three to four days to spare.</p>
<p>The traverse is almost entirely above the treeline, where the whiteout conditions are common and can cause one to turn back. Besides the right apparel, a map and compass are essential.</p>
<p>The first day is the toughest, with 4,000 feet to climb over the 3.8-mile Valley Way Trail to the peak of Mt. Madison. Continuing south on the Gulfside Trail, backpackers summit Adams and Jefferson to earn the right to lie down in the grass of Monticello Lawn.</p>
<p>Appreciate the rest, because Mt. Washington—the highest peak in the White Mountains—is next. Expect bad weather before reaching the snack bar at the summit, which tourists reach by road and rail.</p>
<p>From there the climbing is largely over, while the views of the southern Presidential range are not. The Crawford Path, the oldest continually maintained footpath in the U.S., leads to the Lake of the Huts and Mount Monroe. The going only gets easier past mounts Franklin, Eisenhower, Pierce, and Jackson.</p>
<h2>8. Olympic National Park</h2>
<p><em>Mileage varies, 1-3 days, Moderate to Difficult</em></p>
<h6>With roughly 600 miles of trails, there are essentially endless opportunities for backpacking in Olympic National Park <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/daveynin/"">David Fulmer</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>At 1,442 square miles, Washington's Olympic National Park is nearly twice as large as Great Smoky Mountain National Park, and 300 square miles larger than Yosemite. The park has more than 600 miles of sensational trails, the majority of which are designated wilderness by the National Park Service, and 60 miles of craggy and picturesque coastline.</p>
<p>The backpacking options are numerous, but summitting Mt. Olympus, the tallest peak in the park, is a must. A campground within the park’s Hoh Rainforest is open year-round, so stay there and you can also enjoy backpacking the trail to Royal Basin and the Upper Royal Basin beyond where unparalleled views of glacial mountains and tarns await.</p>
<p>Easier hikes, from LaPush to Shi Shi and the popular Ruby Beach, are also often rewarded with whale sightings.</p>
<h2>9. Teton Crest Trail</h2>
<p><em>25 miles, 2-4 days, Difficult</em></p>
<h6>Backpacking along Paintbrush Divide, arguably the most scenic stretch along the Teton Crest Trail <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/btsaunders/"">Brian Saunders</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>If the <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/jackson-hole-wy/backpacking-camping/teton-crest-trail"">Teton Crest Trail</a> is not on your bucket list, it should be. Check it off by taking on the 25-mile section between Death Canyon to Cascade Canyon, and conquer the Alaska Basin and Hurricane Pass in the process.</p>
<p>The Phillips Pass Trailhead, halfway up Teton Pass, is the place to start. Plan to camp at Alaska Basin where a permit is not required because it lies just outside the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park.</p>
<p>Return to the park the next day to go up and over Hurricane Pass, and down into the South Fork of Cascade Canyon. End your Crest Trail trip there or head up the North Fork of Cascade Canyon to your last campsite. That would give you another day to hike Lake Solitude as well as <a href=""https://rootsrated.com/jackson-hole-wy/hiking/paintbrush-to-cascade-canyon"">Paintbrush Divide and Paintbrush Canyon</a>, stopping at the North Jenny Lake parking area.</p>
<h2>10. Old Rag in Shenandoah National Park, VA</h2>
<p><em>10 miles, 1 day, Difficult</em></p>
<h6>Breathlessly drinking in the views of Shenandoah National Park <small> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/btsaunders/"">David Fulmer</a> </small>
</h6>
<p>The Old Rag Loop is the most challenging of the more than 500 trail miles within Shenandoah National Park in VA. It may be only 10 miles, but it takes 8 hours to complete, according to the National Park Service. They're not joking.</p>
<p>The most popular way to hike the Old Rag Loop is up the Ridge Trail, across the rock scramble to the summit, than down the Saddle Trail to the Weakley Hollow Fire Road.</p>
<p>The first two miles of the wooded trail gets increasingly steeper, and the vegetation changes noticeably. Once you're out of the woods onto the ridgetop, the scrambling over giant granite boulders begins. From the summit, you can breathlessly drink in the 200,000-acre expanse of the Shenandoah National Park, a portion of which is federally designated wilderness.</p>
<p>From here it is advisable to take the Saddle Trail, a fire road, back to your vehicle. It's 1.2 miles longer but much flatter and quicker.</p>

<p>What comes to mind when you hear the word carbon fiber? For many, it sounds like a material reserved for high-speed Formula 1 race cars and high-end lightweight road bicycles. And while that’s correct, the same material is also used in Superfeet carbon fiber insoles.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber puts the “super” in Superfeet — carbon fiber gives our insoles an edge in weight, feel, and performance that is unrivaled in conventional insoles.</p>
<p>But what are the benefits of having carbon fiber insoles, and is it worth it to invest in this extra technology? Good questions! Our Superfeet experts are here to answer those questions and help you determine if carbon fiber insoles are the way for you to reach that next level of comfort and performance.</p>
<p>So, lace up those tennis shoes or hiking boots and get ready to learn about carbon fiber insoles and how they can make a world of difference for your feet.</p>

<h2>Carbon Fiber Insoles, Use Cases &amp; Benefits</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Using carbon fiber insoles can add a competitive edge to any sport, something professional athletes know all about. By slipping a carbon fiber insole into your shoe, you are upping your game with superior technology that imparts the advantage of a lightweight, strong, firm base to work with.</p>
<p>Several Superfeet insoles feaure a carbon fiber-blended stabilizer cap, using a material we call EVOLyte®. EVOlyte is a blend of carbon fiber and polymer plastic that provides a responsive and resilient underfoot experience. Think of it as Superfeet’s secret sauce.</p>
<p>You will find these carbon fiber-blended insoles under the feet of professional runners and hockey players. But you will also find them under the feet of dedicated weekend warriors. These carbon fiber insoles will spring back to their original shape time and time again throughout the hard hikes and long walks you put them through. That’s why pros and Everyday Joes alike love them because they are incredibly durable and offer weight-defying support.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber insoles are best used in sports that have a lot of impact and movement, like running, hiking, walking, and hockey. They offer great shock absorption and an additional level of comfort. They can even help prevent injuries to keep you going faster and longer. The arch support is defined in these insoles and creates a stable footbed from which to propel your feet.</p>
<p>Using a carbon fiber insole can also help alleviate foot pain and ailments such as plantar fasciitis, turf toe, and other common injuries that plague athletes.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, carbon fiber insoles have progressed a lot. The history of these high-tech insoles dates back to 2013 when Superfeet developed EVOLyte, our signature proprietary carbon fiber-polymer blend, in <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-support-low-arch"">Superfeet Run Support Low Arch</a>. At the time, this was one of the most innovative, high-performance Superfeet insoles ever created — a Superhero Superfeet if you will!</p>
<p>Since then, Superfeet has incorporated innovative EVOLyte technology into the following products:</p>

<h2>Are Carbon Fiber Insoles just for pro athletes?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Oftentimes people think that carbon fiber insoles are reserved only for professional athletes or hardcore sports enthusiasts. While the pros do love using carbon fiber insoles, it’s not solely reserved for such athletes — anyone can benefit from this technology.</p>
<p>The Superfeet carbon fiber insoles are for anyone who is doing hard impact activities and prefers a more responsive underfoot feel and experience.</p>
<p>Think about a nice carbon fiber road bicycle. While the pros ride these bikes in the Tour de France, weekend warriors who ride around town also purchase carbon fiber bicycles because of the lightweight frame and strength and stability they provide.</p>
<p>It is the same story for insoles. While someone climbing Mount Everest or running an Ironman Race will benefit greatly from a carbon fiber insole, you get the same benefits on your weekend hike or local 5K charity run.</p>
<p>The truth is that sometimes the average athlete can even benefit more from carbon fiber running shoes or a rigid carbon fiber shoe insert because of the gap it fills between the average runner and a pro.</p>
<p>Pros are so strong, fast, and proficient that a carbon fiber insole will help them, but only so much. For us mere mortals, the transformative nature of adding a carbon fiber insole can take our game up a notch, or even two!</p>
<p>The main advantages of going with carbon fiber insoles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Strong and stiff</li>
<li>Solid arch support</li>
<li>Reactive sole</li>
<li>Firm structure</li>
<li>Injury prevention</li>
<li>Incredibly durable</li>
<li>A very high strength-to-weight ratio</li>
</ul>

<h2>For which foot ailment cases is it best to use Carbon Fiber Insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Another major benefit in going with a carbon fiber insole is that it can help alleviate common injuries or leg pain that many people face.</p>
<p>All Superfeet insoles, including those with EVOLyte, have a biomechanics-based orthotic design that helps cradle the heel and stabilize the foot.</p>
<p>This means that a carbon fiber insole can be beneficial to those experiencing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osteoarthritis in the big toe or midfoot</li>
<li>Long-term navicular fractures</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"">Plantar fasciitis</a></li>
<li>Hallux rigidus</li>
<li>Lisfranc injury</li>
<li>Various stress fractures</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve ever combatted any of these injuries, you know how serious and debilitating they can be. By adding a carbon fiber insole to your shoes or boots, the high-end technology can help lessen these problems, or even prevent them from occuring in the first place.</p>
<p>A carbon fiber insole is not a magic bullet that will cure foot and body ailments, however, when used correctly, it is best for anyone who prioritizes stability and support over flexibility and cushion.</p>
<p>If you have ever used a custom foot orthotic with success or have a recent history of injury or pain and want to prevent painful injuries in the future, a insole made with carbon fiber might be great fit for you.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits of using Carbon Fiber Insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The high-end technology used in carbon fiber shoe inserts has a wide array of benefits. Often, it’s best to experience it firsthand, but we will do our best to explain what these benefits are and how they can help you.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber is a low-density material with a very high strength-to-weight ratio. This means that the insoles offer the athlete a very stiff insole with high tensile strength. While it is strong, it is also very lightweight and offers a high-temperature tolerance.</p>
<p>All this technology and science translates to a top-of-the-line experience for the user. The primary benefits of using carbon fiber inserts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Slim shape</li>
<li>More support</li>
<li>Shock absorption</li>
<li>Presence underfoot</li>
<li>Maximized responsiveness</li>
<li>Reduce risk of new injuries</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the reason pro athletes love to use carbon fiber insoles. But anyone who is participating in a high-impact activity such as running, hiking, hockey, or skiing and snowboarding will feel the benefits of a carbon fiber insole.</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles made with EVOLyte can help athletes of all levels reduce foot fatigue while gaining efficiency. It creates a responsive experience that delivers exceptional comfort and smooth and efficient energy transfer through your gait from foot strike to toe-off.</p>

<h2>Do Carbon Fiber Insoles help improve performance?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>So, carbon fiber insoles sound great if you are looking to go lightweight or prevent injuries, but what if you are looking to improve your performance on the trail, field, or ice?</p>
<p>Well, we are here to tell you that Superfeet carbon fiber insoles absolutely do have the ability to improve performance! With a carbon fiber insert with EVOlyte technology in your shoes, boots, or skates, you can expect to run faster, hike higher, and skate longer.</p>
<p>Take the <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-performance"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/hockey-performance"">Superfeet Hockey Performance insole</a> for instance. This product offers everyone from NHL pros to recreation league skaters up to 11% better acceleration on the ice, unrivaled edge control, and exceptional energy transfer.</p>
<p>These insoles are designed for tight turns, crossovers, quick starts, and hard stops.They are a genuine game-changer.</p>
<p>According to some studies, carbon fiber can help to better distribute the kinetic energy, causing an increase of up to 2% higher on vertical jumps, and thanks to the lightweight and slim shape, they are also more comfortable and manageable for runners.</p>
<p>Using our EVOlyte carbon fiber-polymer blend allows Superfeet to produce a product that is incredibly durable with weight-defying support, so you see the gains in your game.</p>

<h3>Short answer: Yes. Almost everyone can benefit from putting footbeds (also called insoles, inserts or orthotics, depending where you shop) in their ski boots.</h3>
<p>A quality supportive footbed really is the foundation of a good fit in a ski boot.</p>
<p>Footbeds are often forgotten by some ski shops until you are on the way to the cash register. And often, footbeds are sold like a shoe salesman trying to sell you a tin of polish.</p>
<p>As a skier, you deserve the very best fit from your new ski boots. The footbed should always be an integral part of the fitting process for ski boots.</p>
<h2>Assessing Your Footbeds in Ski Boots</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post about ski boot fitting, every good boot fitting should start with an assessment. During this assessment your boot fitter will be looking at the flexibility of your foot. How much does it change between you being seated and standing up? How about when you apply weight as you flex? These changes, along with other observations, should guide the ski boot fitter towards a level of support for you within your ski boot.</p>
<h2>Fitting Your Ski Boots Correctly</h2>
<p>For the majority of skiers, about 85%, the foot will elongate as you flex in a ski boot — the toes will crash into the front of the boot as the foot gets longer. A good boot fitter will explain this to you and show you what is happening with these movements. A suitable footbed can be used to stabilize any excessive motion and help control your foot movements inside your ski boot. Lack of this support inside the boot is the main reason people end up purchasing a boot that's too big for them.</p>
<h2>Do I need Insoles if I Don't Have Arch Problems?</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of skiers have feet that are rigid and inflexible. While these people don’t <em>need</em> a footbed for stability, they can definitely still benefit from insoles in their ski boots. By filling the gaps under the feet, skiers who use insoles in their ski boots can ski for longer without the pains associated with all their body weight going through a small portion of their feet. The insoles help spread the load like a foundation does for a house, resulting in improved control and reduced fatigue.</p>
<p>What of the remaining 15% of skiers? These lucky people have feet made for the slopes, with just enough flexibility to absorb shocks, but not so much that the feet collapse and change size as they move. Why is a footbed in the ski boot important for these people? The simple and important answer is comfort and performance.</p>

<div>
<p>Your ski boot fitter has spent time finding a boot to match the shape of your foot. Most ski boots are now either heat moldable in terms of liner or shell, meaning you are getting a customized fit for the sides and top of your feet. Why not customize the fit beneath your foot too? When you give complete contact beneath your feet, you spread the load and put your foot in its best functioning position.</p>
<p>And that, fellow skiers, means a great day on the mountain for you, and your feet.</p>

<p>When you select new running shoes or hiking boots, odds are you put a lot of work and research into choosing the right fit for you. From tread to laces, weight to durability, you take everything into account to find the perfect pair of shoes or boots. So why not invest the same amount of energy into selecting the right insole for that footwear?</p>
<p>Think of it like this — you wouldn’t go out and spend a lot of money on a new Jeep Wrangler for intense four-wheeling adventures and then run stock tires on it. In the same way, you should not buy a new pair of hiking boots or running shoes and use the stock insole that comes with it.</p>
<p>A little upgrade can go a long way.</p>
<p>The insole that comes with your shoe, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/origins-of-orthotic-insoles"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/origins-of-orthotic-insoles"">sometimes called the sockliner</a>, isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just designed for anyone’s foot.</p>
<p>But you are not anyone. You are you, and you need an insole that fits your foot and needs well. But how to find that? Many people don’t know where to start. Well, good news, Superfeet is here to help. We know a thing or two about what goes into finding the right insole for the right foot. When it comes to hard vs. soft orthotics, we’ve compiled a little guide on how to find what works best for your feet, and your adventures.</p>
<p>Having a good hard or soft insole can make or break a good hike or run. Finding the right insole means you can focus on fun, not foot discomfort.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Soft vs. Hard Insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>After a long day, whether it is around town or on a trail, the last thing you want is to feel the wear of miles on your feet. Ideally, you want your feet to feel just as good getting in bed at night as you did getting out of bed in the morning. A good insole can make that dream a reality.</p>
<p>Because there are lots of different types of feet, shoes, and preferences, Superfeet offers a wide range of soft insoles and hard insoles ranging from soft foam insoles, semi-rigid arch supports, and hard plastic orthotics.</p>
<p>One of the first questions to consider when selecting the right insole for you is — how do you want the insole to feel?</p>
<p>Insoles are a little like mattresses in that some people prefer soft and cushioned, while others want something firm. To know the answer to the hard vs. soft orthotics question, it helps to know a little more about the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each of these two types of insoles.</p>
<p>For many, the natural thought is that softer is better when it comes to selecting an insole, however, this is not always the case. Superfeet’s soft insoles provide an adaptive underfoot experience, full of flexibility, cushion, and step-in comfort, built on the foundation of the <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/comfort-science"">signature Superfeeet orthotic shape</a>. While soft or squishy insoles from other brands might feel good at first, they often don’t hold their shape and lack stability and support.</p>
<p>Inversely, harder polymer-based or carbon fiber-based orthotics offer more structure and responsiveness. These hard insoles are what Superfeet dubs a “responsive underfoot experience,” which offers more support and presence underfoot and is designed to be more present under your foot, which can accelerate the effect of the Superfeet insole’s shape.</p>
<p>Think of walking on a warm sandy beach. As you approach the salty sea, the sand is warm, soft and cushy. Your feet sink in and have a comfortable experience at first but require pressure to walk and over time it becomes tiresome and even painful slogging through soft sand.</p>
<p>Now as you approach the water where the white frothy waves have lapped up on the sand, the wet beach is firm and responsive, and you sink in less. The hard wet sand is easier to walk on but is a little less forgiving on your feet.</p>
<p>The orthotic shape of Superfeet is the firm sand providing a structure and base for feet to work from. You wouldn’t build a house on sand, and you shouldn’t make it the base for your feet either. The shape is the essential life-changing technology under every foot, and shape is the core of everything Superfeet does.</p>
<p>The right Superfeet insole depends on your specific foot shape, any pain you are experiencing and what activity you are doing. Consider that a tight shoe may require a thinner, hard insole, while a roomy shoe could fit a thicker, soft insole.</p>

<h2>Soft Insoles Pros and Cons</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>A soft insole can feel like walking on a bed of clouds.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to soft insoles, however, as with anything, there are also some things that you as the wearer might not like about a softer insole.</p>
<p>Some of the positives of soft insoles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight and gentle feel underfoot</li>
<li>Engineered with comfort and flexibility in mind</li>
<li>Maximizes each step’s cushion</li>
<li>Easy to break-in</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the limitations of soft insoles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can feel like not enough shape, especially if you are used to a harder orthotic</li>
<li>Relies more on the structure of the shoe to influence shape</li>
<li>Depending on thickness, can take up too much space in the shoe</li>
</ul>
<p>A soft insole helps absorb shock and reduce friction as well in Superfeet’s three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured heel cup</li>
<li>Rearfoot support</li>
<li>Reinforced foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities for soft insoles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Casual</li>
<li>Everyday use</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are pluses and minuses to both, the engineering and materials used to create soft insoles from Superfeet are top of the line.</p>
<p>Some of our more soft, flexible insoles use patented Adaptive Comfort Technology™. This is a fancy way to say the insoles adapt and flex to the way your foot moves.</p>
<p>The durometer, the standardized measurement of the hardness of a material, finds that a polymer in a soft insole is lower. That means that the change in the shoe will be minimal and can work for any type of activity from walking, running, and hiking, to business meetings.</p>

<h2>Hard Insoles Pros and Cons</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Responsive, structured, and ready to go — hard insoles are great for some situations but may not work for everyone.</p>
<p>Like soft insoles, hard insoles come with benefits and drawbacks as well. Knowing what these are can guide you in finding the correct insole.</p>
<p>Some of the positives of hard insoles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stiffer, more present feel underfoot</li>
<li>Maximum shape and support</li>
<li>Can be similar to the feel of prescription orthotics</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the limitations of hard insoles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people prefer a softer feel</li>
<li>Longer adjustment or break-in time</li>
<li>Available room in the shoe can become an issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities for hard insoles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Casual</li>
<li>Everyday use</li>
</ul>
<p>Firm or hard insoles are ideal for people who have previously used and had success with a custom foot orthotic or have suffered an injury or are trying to prevent injuries. Responsive insoles are there for your feet and assist in keeping you upright and moving in any situation. Think solid, as these insoles will be there when you need them.</p>
<p>Hard insoles use a variety of high-quality materials such as polypropylene and carbon fiber to provide a responsive footbed.</p>
<p>Superfeet hard insoles use EVOlyte® Carbon Fiber enhanced materials. Think of the carbon fiber materials used in a high-end bicycle — it is strong but lightweight. Superfeet harnesses the same material and benefits in insoles built with EVOLyte, our proprietary carbon fiber blend.</p>
<p>These hard insoles usually have a higher durometer number too. Think of it like turning the volume up on the footbed radio — you can’t miss the support.</p>
<p>With hard insoles, good for skiing, hiking, running, walking, and everyday life, the structure, and shape stay present the entire life of the insole (for Superfeet, that’s 500 miles or one full year of use, whichever comes first). It is more resilient and responsive.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Now that you have all this knowledge about hard vs. soft orthotics, what is the right fit for you? Having hard or soft orthotics for <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"">plantar fasciitis</a> or similar foot or leg pain can make or break a good hike.</p>
<p>With the right Superfeet in your shoes, you can enhance performance and run longer, hike farther, and walk pain-free all while reducing foot fatigue and helping to eliminate foot and lower leg injuries.</p>
<p>The right insole for you depends on the activity you will do, along with your foot type, any injuries or ailments you may suffer from, and most importantly: your personal preference. Superfeet offers a wide range of insoles for every activity, including <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/running"">insoles for running</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hiking"">insoles for hiking</a>, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/dress"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/dress"">insoles for casual and dress footwear</a> and even <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/collections/hockey-skates"">insoles for your hockey skates</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I take care of my insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Just as you care for your car by washing and regularly maintaining it, you will want to do the same for your Superfeet. By taking care of your dirty insoles, you will prolong the life and effectiveness of both hard insoles and soft insoles alike.</p>
<p>One of the easiest and best things that you can do to care for your Superfeet is to take them out of the shoe or boot and let them air dry after an activity. Just like you need fresh air after a long run, your insoles like to breathe a bit too.</p>
<p>Humidity, dirt, and bacteria are all enemies of soft foam insoles and can lead to a breakdown in the materials.</p>
<p>It also helps to hand-wash both soft insoles and hard insoles occasionally with mild soap, lukewarm water, and an old toothbrush. Never machine wash or dry your insoles, and keep them away from heat sources. It’s best to just let them air dry or use a soft towel.</p>
<p>With proper care and maintenance, you can count on reliable comfort and support from your hard or soft orthotics for up to 12 months or 500 miles, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>You are sure to enjoy many comfortable adventures in that time, and your feet will thank you.</p>

<p>There are three types of runners in this world: those who love running, those who don’t love it but know it’s great exercise, and those who do it because they have to.</p>
<p>Many boxers fall into that last category: they run because they have to. Boxers know that running increases endurance in the ring and helps you when you are in the last 30 seconds of those three minute rounds.</p>
<p>Boxing and running are both aerobic exercises, that’s why roadwork (aka a boxer’s term for running) goes hand-in-hand with boxing. Aerobic exercise refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism.</p>
<h2>Running for Boxing: Advantages to Running Outdoors</h2>
<p>Why do boxers call running roadwork? Running is referred to in the boxing world as roadwork because fighters are usually sent outdoors to get their miles in on streets and roads. While there are times when running on a treadmill is necessary, there are many advantages to running outdoors, especially for a boxer.</p>
<p>When you run outdoors you are completely responsible for carrying your own bodyweight. If you run one mile down the road, you have to run another mile to get back to where you started. Running outdoors means you have to face and adapt to the elements of nature. It can be 100 degrees outside, or 40 degrees outside. Either way, running in the elements can build mental fortitude, something truly coveted in a boxer.</p>
<h2>Running for Boxing: Advantages to Running on a Treadmill</h2>
<p>Running on a treadmill can help prevent and reduce injury — a treadmill gives you a predictable, forgiving surface with a little give to every step. Another advantage of running on the treadmill is that you can more consciously maintain a certain pace. Finally, running on a treadmill is very convenient. You can run on the treadmill rain or shine, late or early without needing to pay attention to the weather or time of day.</p>
<h2>Boxing Running Workout</h2>
<p>Here’s a sample roadwork session for anyone who wants to run like a boxer, whether you’re getting in your miles on the road or on the treadmill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start out jogging at a medium pace for 3 minutes (breathing should be normal, and you heart rate should gradually increase).</li>
<li>For the next 20 minutes run at your average pace (try to keep this pace for the entire 20 minutes).</li>
<li>For the next 10 minutes, at the top of each minute, sprint for 10 seconds (if running outside, sprint between every few light poles to raise your heart rate and lower it while doing roadwork).</li>
<li>Progression: The next time you do your roadwork increase the overall amount of time of your run. Sprint at 45 second intervals instead of one minute intervals.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Whether you’ve never heard of plantar fasciitis or you know it’s agonizing wrath all too well, learning about what causes the painful foot condition and how it can be treated will put you one step ahead (pun intended) in avoiding its harmful effects, especially if you’re active on your feet.</p>
<p>Combining the right footwear with cushioned yet supportive inso<span>les, like Superfeet insoles for <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">plantar fasciitis relief</a>, can do m</span>ore than help alleviate the piercing heel pain of plantar fasciitis – it can also help prevent it from ever happening in the first place.</p>
<p>According to Matt Gooch, Certified Pedorthist and Vice President of Product and Innovation at Superfeet, “The signature shape of Superfeet insoles allow them to perfectly fit the contours of your feet, providing unmatched arch support and comfort that can help combat and prevent the stress and strain that leads to common foot conditions like plantar fasciitis. In fact, research has shown Superfeet insoles to reduce strain on the plantar fascia by almost 25%.”</p>

<div>
<h2>Understanding Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>As the name suggests, plantar fasciitis affects the plantar fascia, the connective tissue on the bottom of your foot that runs from your heel bone to your forefoot. Without proper stability and support, the plantar fascia can be overly strained, leading to tears and inflammation. Plantar fasciitis pain is usually felt at the heel, but that’s not the only place the plantar fascia can become inflamed<span>. That’s why insoles for reducing heel pain and inflammation provi</span>de support and cushioning for the whole foot, not just the heel.</p>
<p>Runners often suffer from plantar fasciitis but working long hours on your feet or walking on hard, unforgiving surfaces in flat shoes can cause too much strain on your plantar fascia as well. Flexible feet that don’t have properly structured footwear an<span>d inserts for better foot stability and balance can </span>be particularly prone to the condition. Having the right amount of cushioning that reduces impact forces and arch support that allows your foot to maintain its natural shape can work wonders to prevent plantar fasciitis.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>How Superfeet Insoles Provide Relief from Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>One of the best things you can do to not only treat your pain in the short term but also prevent it from coming back in the future is to invest in the right p<span>air of arch support insoles for reducing stress on the plantar fascia. </span>Because the plantar fascia is the main structure making up the arch of your foot, keeping it properly supported is key. An insole constructed using soft foam combined with durable arch support not only cushions the foot but keeps it stable and supported in its natural shape, even when standing for long hours on hard surfaces.</p>
<p>Not all insoles are created equal. Orthotics for plantar fasciitis usually have both cushioned foam for comfort and strong arch support for stability. The softness of cheap gel inserts may be appealing for temporary relief but won’t solve the problem, while orthotics prescribed by a podiatrist may offer a custom fit but are expensive and may only work in certain shoes.</p>
<p><span>Choosing the right insole for your specific plantar fasciitis need, like insoles for <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-pain-relief"">running</a> and athletic shoes or insoles for <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">casual footwear</a>, dress shoes and work boots, is</span> an important factor to consider because the better your insoles fit your shoes, the better they’ll feel under your feet.</p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<h2>Choosing the Right Superfeet Insoles for Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Because of their unique signature shape that fits like a puzzle piece under each foo<span>t, Superfeet products reduce stress on the feet and even joints like ankles and knees. Superfeet inserts can also improve gait and posture </span>which helps your whole body feel good.</p>
<p>For a specific condition like plantar fasciitis, Superfeet Pain Relief insoles were created to do exactly what the name implies: relieve pain. <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">Casual Pain Relief</a> insoles are designed for casual shoes while <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-pain-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/run-pain-relief"">Run Pain Relief</a> insoles work great for athletic-style footwear. Both feature therapeutic foam for plush cushioning and EVOLyte® stabilizer caps infused with carbon fiber for responsive, lightweight arch support. They are also the only Superfeet insoles that come with an independent heel stabilizer, to keep the pain-relieving shape close to the foot.</p>

<div>
<h2>Lifestyle Changes to Help Alleviate Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Giving your feet proper support and cushioning is the best way to directly combat plantar fasciitis, but certain lifestyle changes can also make a difference. Staying off your feet as much as possible when experiencing extreme pain can limit inflammation. Shortening your run or taking a break from recreational activities can give your feet time to heal.</p>
<p>In conjunction with giving your feet a rest, there are a few <a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"">plantar fasciitis stretches</a> and muscle strengthening exercises that can relieve pain and help prevent future injury. Stretching the plantar fascia while massaging the pain point, stretching and training your calves and even “toe yoga” can all help treat plantar fasciitis.</p>

<div>
<p>Everyone complains about their ""dogs"" occasionally. But for people who are on their feet most of the day, any type of foot problem is a serious one. It's hard to concentrate on your job or your family when your feet hurt. You may take every opportunity to kick off your shoes and rub the soles of your feet (which can be embarrassing if the boss wanders by). Foot pain has many causes, but for some, the pain can stem from having high arches.</p>
</div>
<h2>What are high arches?</h2>
<div>
<p>While there’s no standard measurement to indicate whether your arches should be deemed “high,” you are said to have high arches if you have significant height at the arch of your feet. When you walk barefoot in the sand, your tracks may show only your heel and ball of your foot, with little to no imprint in the middle.</p>
</div>
<h2>Causes of high arches</h2>
<div>
<p>The shape of your feet is determined, for the most part, by genes. People with high arches may feel that their feet are abnormal, but that’s simply not true — everyone’s feet are unique, whether their arches are flat, high or somewhere in between. It’s important to note, however, that high arched feet can also be caused by a variety of neurological conditions, like spina bifida and cerebral palsy.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of high arches</h2>
<div>
<p>As with most foot issues, symptoms can vary. If you have high arches, you may find physical activity painful. High-arched feet often tend to be more rigid and less flexible, which often leads people to seek out extra cushioning in insoles and footwear. People with high arches may have trouble finding footwear that fits well and often experience excess friction or pressure at the instep of the foot.</p>

<p>Not everyone sees the beauty in a 3 a.m. wake-up call to run a leg of a 200-mile race. It takes a special kind of runner to push themselves beyond neighborhood 5Ks and opt for boundary-pushing relay races. For those who do, however, the rewards are far greater than a medal or participant t-shirt (even the nice technical ones!). The true prizes are exchanging those lonely training days for group runs as you buoy each other to race day, seeing the looks on your teammates’ exhausted-but-jubilant faces as you speed toward camp, and sweaty hugs as you cross the finish line together. The prizes are singing songs in the vans, tossing each other nutrition gels around camp and trading war stories and PRs over beers later. Most relays are 200-ish miles and call for teams of 12, with each runner taking on three legs each. If you can run a 10K, a relay is within your sights. And if you can appreciate the camaraderie-fueled bragging rights of a relay run, start brainstorming a punny team name and check out this list of 10 of the best races.</p>
<h3>1. Hood to Coast Relay</h3>
<p>Where: Oregon</p>
<p>When: August</p>
<p>Race founder Bob Foote combined two iconic Oregon locales when the ultra-marathoner designed <a href=""http://hoodtocoast.com/"">this race</a> in 1982: Mount Hood and the beach. This scenic 199-miler kicks off at the Timberline Day Lodge (elevation 6,000 feet) on the south side of Mount Hood, heads toward the City of Roses, then stumbles onto the coast at Seaside. Festive runners start the party vibe before they reach the beach with superhero costumes, tutus and wigs. The ""Mother of All Relays"" started with just eight teams, but is now the largest with 1,050 teams. The race has sold out for 26 years straight, making it so popular that team slots are now filled by a lottery system.</p>
<h3>2. Ragnar SoCal</h3>
<p>Where: California</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why this Ragnar is one of the most popular of the race series: The <a href=""https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/relay/southerncalifornia"">200-mile-ish race</a> starts in Huntington Beach following a patchwork of bike paths, coastal trails and boardwalks along the Pacific Coast to Silver Strand State Beach in San Diego. Beach views in daydream-worthy places like Cardiff-by-the-Sea and Mission Beach are constant companions, though nocturnal runners have to imagine them during this overnight race. A troupe of decorated support vans—a race tradition—caravans along the coast to drop off runners at exchange points.</p>
<h3>3. American Odyssey Relay</h3>
<p>Where: Washington DC</p>
<p>When: April</p>
<p>This <a href=""http://americanodysseyrelay.com/"">Mid-Atlantic race</a> prides itself on being a race by and for runners. Organizers took 18 months to develop the course, which is as scenic as it is historically significant. It starts in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, within spitting distance of Civil War battlefields, before rolling through 200 miles and four states (including Washington DC). Much of the route follows a clover-leaf pattern, each time bringing runners back to a central camp before guiding them past other Civil War landmarks like Harpers Ferry and down bucolic farm roads before ending at the SW Waterfront in Washington, DC.</p>

<h3>4. Top of Zion Relay</h3>
<p>Where: Utah</p>
<p>When: June</p>
<p>This <a href=""https://topofzion.com/"">race</a> isn’t for the faint of heart—since it often leads to a faintness of breath. Teams ascend and descend more than 14,000 feet in elevation through rugged and awe-inspiring landscapes in one of the most challenging relays around. The 195-mile road race starts at Capitol Reef National Park, following along Utah’s All-American Road (aka Highway 12) past Dixie National Forest, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Bryce Canyon National Park, ending at a Zion National Park overlook.</p>
<h3>5. Kentucky Bourbon Chase</h3>
<p>Where: Kentucky</p>
<p>When: October</p>
<p>This <a href=""https://www.bourbonchase.com/"">race</a> is the booziest of relays. The 200-mile route follows the Kentucky Bourbon Trail past six historic distilleries, from Jim Beam to Maker’s Mark. Of course, runners may not be doing much drinking during the race, but the course passes the Bluegrass State’s best—miles of verdant horse pastures and pastoral small towns. And if you do want a drink, you’ll find Wild Turkey waiting at the finish.</p>
<h3>6. Ragnar Reach the Beach</h3>
<p>Where: New Hampshire When: September</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/ragnar-reach-the-beach-en-1502311113.jpg""></p>
<h6>The Ragnar Relay in New Hampshire is one of the oldest in the country. Photo courtesy of Ragnar</h6>
<p>This <a href=""https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/relay/reachthebeach"">race</a> has longevity in its favor—it’s one of the oldest and longest-running relays in the U.S. And it’s easy to see why: The race coincides with New England’s leaf peeping season, so the 200-mile route from Bretton Woods Ski area to Hampton Beach State Park is lined with colorful foliage. The moderate road route has awe-inspiring views of lakes, scenic covered bridges and mountain views that help the miles slip away.</p>
<h3>7. Smoky Mountain Relay</h3>
<p>Where: North Carolina</p>
<p>When: April</p>
<p>Appalachia is a mecca for outdoor sports, and <a href=""http://smokymountainrelay.com/"">this race</a> calls those who seek mountain running. Teams don reflective vests and gear for this 206-mile overnight race that travels from just outside Brevard to the Nantahala Outdoor Center in Bryson City. The route has a mix of surfaces with sections of asphalt, gravel and dirt trail. The latter features sections of the forested Mountains to Sea trail with several creek crossings.</p>
<h3>8. Ragnar South Beach</h3>
<p>Where: Florida</p>
<p>When: November</p>
<p>With this course debuting in 2017, <a href=""https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/relay/southbeach"">Ragnar South Beach</a> will draw those who love a beach view, but also love running. The gun goes off in Melbourne Beach, Florida, then follows the sparkling Atlantic 200 miles through towns like West Palm Beach via several sandy, beach exchange points. The finish line is on Miami’s glitzy Ocean Drive, where bars await for after-parties. Teams can also pair this race with another of Ragnar’s southeastern U.S. races to earn the Southern Discomfort Double Medal with a road-and-trail combo.</p>
<h3>9. Ragnar Trail Wawayanda Lake</h3>
<p>Where: New Jersey</p>
<p>When: October</p>
<h6> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/ragnar-trail-wawayanda-lake-en-1502311078.jpg""><br>The Ragnar Trail Wawayanda Lake is like a running camp for adults. Photo courtesy of Ragnar.<br><br>
</h6>
<p>The newest East Coast race in the Ragnar series, <a href=""https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/trail/wawayandalake"">this relay</a> is also the closest to New York City. New York Road Runners, organizers of the New York City Marathon, co-sponsor this race 50 miles outside the Big Apple. Runners will set up camp on the shores of northern New Jersey’s Wawayanda Lake, where beers and bonfires await when competitors return from running sections of the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<h3>10. Lake Tahoe Marathon Relay</h3>
<p>Where: California/Nevada</p>
<p>When: October</p>
<p>Consider <a href=""http://www.laketahoemarathon.com/"">this marathon</a> a warm up for full-scale relays. A marathon relay means shorter stints: At this race, competitors run one 10K, instead of a few, as they would over the course of a full-length relay. It’s also a bit less tiring since it doesn’t stretch into the night. Yet, the scenery is just as stunning and the team solidarity as fulfilling. The course traces the rim of Lake Tahoe—offering 26.2 miles of stunning Lake Tahoe views, including a stop at Inspiration Point above Emerald Bay.</p>

<p>While metatarsalgia sounds exotic, the pain it brings to athletes and others is not. Simply put, metatarsalgia affects the ball of the foot, causing tenderness, serious pain and inflammation. The pain usually originates at the end of one or more of the metatarsal bones, which means just running or walking may cause increased pain. While the condition is most often associated with athletes who subject their feet to high impact activities on a daily basis, the average person can develop the condition as well. Over a period of months, the pain worsens, making even daily activities a challenge. Fortunately, sufferers can find relief through a variety of methods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Symptoms of Metatarsalgia</h2>
<div>
<p>Symptoms of metatarsalgia can include a sharp, aching or burning pain right behind the toes, but it can also present as general pain and tenderness in the forefoot. The pain may increase when sufferers flex their feet, run or even stand. The toes can become numb and sufferers can experience intense, shooting pains. Finally, those with metatarsalgia may constantly feel as if they have something hard in their shoes.</p>

Text on image that says ""Those with Metatarsalgia may feel like they have something hard in their shoes.""' style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></picture><picture> </picture></figure>
<h2>Causes of Metatarsalgia</h2>
<div>
<p>Runners, soccer players and other athletes who put constant pressure on their forefeet can experience this chronic inflammation and pain, but high impact activities aren't the only cause of the condition. Patients may have malformed feet. Tight or weak toe muscles are also a factor, as are tight Achilles tendons, high arches and hammer toes. Wearing poorly fitting shoes and boots can also cause the problem. Anyone can suffer from metatarsalgia.</p>
</div>
<h2>Treatment for Metatarsalgia</h2>
<div>
<p>There are several approaches to relieving this condition. Perhaps the most common prescription is rest. Those with metatarsalgia are usually advised to take a break from activities and keep their feet up. Icing the affected area several times a day may help, as may some OTC medications, like ibuprofen. In some severe instances, a doctor may use steroid injections to minimize the inflammation.</p>
</div>
<h2>Superfeet for Metatarsalgia or Forefoot Pain</h2>

<div>
<p>When equipping their feet with new shoes or boots, people don’t often think about one very important aspect: the part of the shoe that your foot will rest on day in and day out. Shoppers will often focus on other things about their shoes, like the fit or color. While these are all good considerations when selecting footwear, it is just as important to ask yourself, “What insoles do I need?”</p>
<p>Think about it this way, your insoles are something that your body is in direct contact with all day long. What else that you wear has this important role? Undershirts, underwear, pants, and shirts. You should consider investing just as much time and money into your insoles as you would into any of these other critical articles of clothing you wear every day.</p>
<p>Selecting the right insole is a very personal matter because there is no other foot out there just like yours, and there are many types of insoles to choose from. The good news is that our Superfeet experts are here to walk, no pun intended, you through the process of how to choose the right insole for you.</p>
<p>We will cover the reason for shoe inserts, how to find the right insoles, and ultimately answer the core question of, “What insoles do I need?”</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<h2>How to choose the right Superfeet Insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Superfeet can be a game changer for athletes and anyone suffering from foot or leg pain. However, it is imperative to find the right Superfeet insoles in order to get the most out of each pair.</p>
<p>Superfeet products are tailored to specific activities, uses, and even styles of footwear. The contours of each insole are strategically positioned to offer maximum impact on the way your specific foot functions as you move.</p>
<p>Regardless of the technology, your comfort is key! If the insole feels uncomfortable to you, try a different Superfeet style. There are plenty to choose from, and there is no reason to be uncomfortable. There is surely a Superfeet that works for your feet.</p>
<p>For the most part, shoes nowadays are built mostly to be fashionable rather than comfortable, and that can be harmful to foot anatomy in the long run. Keep in mind that Superfeet insoles are not exclusive to people with foot ailments and that everyone can benefit from their use.</p>
<p>Superfeet insoles help you move more comfortably so you can focus on what you love, not foot pain. Superfeet insoles provide comfort, pain relief, and performance all at the same time. You can dramatically improve the fit, function, and feel of your footwear by adding a pair of insoles.</p>
<p>The Superfeet shape can reduce foot fatigue and help resolve common foot and lower leg injuries. Finally, you can enhance certain aspects of performance, like going farther or faster, with insoles in your footwear. But don’t just take our word for it, check it out for yourself and feel the difference that Superfeet can provide.</p>

<h2>Common reasons to get Insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The reasons behind why people decide to get insoles are as varied as different foot styles. There are some common reasons why people tend to opt for an insole. Some of the main reasons to get insoles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort - These people are looking to improve the overall fit and feel of their shoes.</li>
<li>Pain relief - Foot pain can be debilitating for many. A lot of people look to insoles as a method to prevent or relieve foot conditions like <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/plantar-fasciitis-explained"">Plantar Fasciitis</a>, general heel pain, <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/metatarsalgia-explained"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blogs/foot-health-podiatry/metatarsalgia-explained"">metatarsalgia</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Performance - The better your footwear fits and feels, the more comfortable you are, and that can keep you moving farther, longer and faster. Some shoppers turn to insoles to help give them a competitive edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may identify with one or all of these categories. The three are not mutually exclusive but are often the driving force behind someone wanting to get Superfeet insoles.</p>
<p>Regardless of the initial reason, almost everyone can benefit from purchasing the right insoles. Whether you bought a new pair of shoes that could use better support, are an avid runner or hiker, or you have to spend long hours standing on your feet or walking all day for work, the right insole can make your life better.</p>
<p>For anyone who connects with the “pain relief” category, some common feet ailments that insoles can help with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch pain</li>
<li>Plantar Fasciitis</li>
<li>Morton’s neuroma</li>
<li>Metatarsalgia</li>
<li>Back pain</li>
<li>Knee pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Any and all of these discomforts can be prevented or alleviated when using the right insoles. If you experience any of these ailments or have some other driving force making you consider what the best arch support insoles are, you qualify for a new pair of Superfeet.</p>

<h2>Foot arch types</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>While every person’s foot is different and personal to them, typically when it comes to arch support people fall into one of three categories: neutral arches, high arches, and flat feet.</p>
<p>The arch of your foot is the center part between the heel and the toe. The arch is a slight curve upward that is designed to help with balancing your body weight as well as the impact from walking, running, or hiking. The arch is very important because it acts like the foundation of a house, keeping your feet and the rest of your body supported as you move throughout your day.</p>
<p>While there is no standard measurement to indicate whether your arches should be deemed “high,” you are said to have high arches if you have significant height at the arch of your feet. When you walk barefoot in the sand, your tracks may show only your heel and the ball of your foot, with little to no imprint in the middle. Alternatively, someone with flat feet (sometimes called “fallen arches”) have minimal to no arch at all. The entire bottom surface of your foot is in complete or near complete contact with the ground while standing.</p>
<p>This is where Superfeet comes in. We make insoles with a wide variety of arch profiles to fit a wide variety of feet.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while the arch type is an important variable that needs to be considered when selecting the right insole, it’s not the only variable. Superfeet knows that there is more to a proper fit than just your arch height. Our insoles are designed to interact with the entire foot, not just one part.</p>

<h2>Types of insoles</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When it comes to the types of insoles, Superfeet has something for everyone. Each different type can be preferable to the other depending on the main purpose of the insole. Whether it’s for hiking, running, working, hockey, or business meetings, we have an insole for every need.</p>
<p>How the insole feels is also an important factor in helping you choose the right one for you. The Superfeet family has insoles with an adaptive underfoot experience, meaning they are more flexible and cushioned, all the way to responsive underfoot experience, which offers more stability and support.</p>

<h2>What elements should I consider when purchasing new Insoles?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When purchasing new insoles there are a variety of things to consider. First, which activities will you be using your insoles for. In most cases, Superfeet are made for specific uses. Second, consider the fit of your shoes. The insoles need to be able to fit well inside your footwear, so the volume/thickness of the insole should be a factor. Finally, how you like your insoles to feel. Insoles are a little like mattresses — some people prefer soft and cushioned while others like a firm, harder mattress.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step set of questions to help walk you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you using the insole?
<ul>
<li>Understanding the activity you will be using the insole for can help pinpoint insoles designed with features and benefits for certain activities</li>
<li>Match the insole to the activity — choose running insoles if you are running or walking for exercise, hiking-specific insoles if you are hitting the trails, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does your shoe fit?
<ul>
<li>Tight, just right, or loose
<ul>
<li>Tighter-fitting footwear, such as dress shoes, cleated shoes, or performance shoes, requires a “Thin” volume insole. This footwear often does not have a removable sockliner, so you’ll need to put your Superfeet directly in the shoe – the thinner the insole, the better.</li>
<li>If your footwear fits “just right,” like in running shoes, casual shoes, etc, and you can remove the sockliner, choose a Medium volume insole</li>
<li>Looser fitting footwear, such as work boots, utility boots, or waders leaves enough space for a “Max” volume insole</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is your desired underfoot experience? In other words, how do you like the insole to feel?
<ul>
<li>Superfeet makes insoles with a wide range of feels – from the flexible cushioning of insoles with Adaptive Comfort Technology to the responsive, more structured support of Superfeet built with EVOLyte carbon fiber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what do you have to look forward to once you have answered the question of, “What insoles do I need?” Well, the sky is the limit once the best Superfeet for you is in your shoe. The following are just a few of the benefits and reasons for shoe inserts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the fit of footwear</li>
<li>Improve the feel of footwear</li>
<li>Improve the function of footwear</li>
<li>Reduce foot fatigue</li>
<li>Resolve common foot and lower leg injuries</li>
<li>Enhance certain aspects of performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Just thinking about plantar fasciitis (plan-tar fass-E-eye-tis) will make even the hardiest athletes cringe.</p>
<p>Not only does the name sound scary, the amount of people that have suffered its wrath of agonizing heel pain will stop you in your tracks. In the running and endurance world, plantar fasciitis is a mainstay and common topic of discussion. Less discussed though is the enormous amount of average non-athletes that also suffer from the condition.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the facts, dispel the myths and go over a few treatment options, including the best insoles for plantar fasciitis.</p>
</div>
<h2>WHAT IS PLANTAR FASCIITIS?</h2>
<div>
<p>Pain in the heel can be attributed to many different conditions caused by a variety of factors that need a range of treatments. We’re focusing just on plantar fasciitis, an intense but treatable pain usually felt on the bottom of the heel right where the calcaneus bone meets the plantar fascia tissue.</p>
<p>Plantar fasciitis is inflammation caused by excessive stretching of the tissue on the bottom of your foot. This broad connective structure is called the plantar fascia and acts like a big rubber band connecting your heel bone to your toes. It is the last line of support as your foot hits the ground.</p>
<p>When walking barefoot on a soft surface, the plantar fascia can easily handle the forces pushing down on it. However, hours of work or running on hard surfaces, especially in flat shoes, can put too much strain on the plantar fascia and cause immense pain at the back of the foot where the fascia tissue meets the heel bone.</p>
<p>An unstable foot may lead to additional stress placed on the plantar fascia during walking, running and prolonged standing. This is the most common cause of “heel pain,” though the heel is not the only area in which the plantar fascia can become inflamed.</p>
</div>
<figure><picture> <source><img style=""float: none;"" alt=""Line drawing of a foot pointing to common areas that are impacted by plantar fascia irritation."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/plantar_fascia_including_achilles_tendon_calcaneus_and_injury_prone_area_640.png""></picture></figure>
<h2>WHAT CAUSES PLANTAR FASCIITIS?</h2>
<div>
<p>The plantar fascia plays a crucial role in helping your foot transition into the propulsive phase of the gait cycle. Like a shock absorber on a car, the foot has two primary motions: a compression phase, called pronation, and a propulsive phase, called supination.</p>
<p>The trouble comes when the foot pronates for a longer period than it should. Like a shock absorber that is already fully compressed (or close to it) at a moment of impact, the shock bottoms out and the ride is a lot less comfortable. When a foot remains pronated for a longer period, it may affect how it absorbs impact and can make standing, walking or running a lot less comfortable, especially on hard surfaces in flat, unsupportive shoes.</p>
<p>A change in the amount of force put on your plantar fascia might trigger plantar fasciitis. For example, if you add miles to your daily run or change your route to run more downhill – your feet experience added force thanks to gravity. If you walk to work and suddenly find yourself with a longer commute or your job requires lifting heavy loads, you will inevitably put added strain on your feet.</p>
<p>The strength of your muscles not only in your feet but your entire lower body could also be a factor when it comes to developing plantar fasciitis. If the muscles in your feet are weak, the plantar fascia picks up the slack to keep your supported. The muscles in your legs and even hips are also vital for stability and help absorb some forces while you move. Your feet could suffer the consequences of weak or fatigued legs. On the flipside, well supported feet can help strengthen and stabilize the complex system of bones, ligaments and muscles working together above the ankle as well as below it, allowing you to feel your best.</p>
</div>
<h2>WHO IS LIKELY TO DEVELOP PLANTAR FASCIITIS?</h2>
<div>
<p>Plantar fascia tissue can lose elasticity over time for a variety of reasons, including sports activity, prolonged standing and high stress or pressure under the heel. Runners, people who are overweight and those who have inadequate support in their footwear are most at risk of developing plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>Athletes participating in long, high-intensity workouts are naturally likely to suffer from plantar fasciitis. Running ultra-marathons across uneven terrain, skiing black diamond slopes or giving it your all on the 400 meter hurdles all obviously increase the strain on your feet.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of scenarios in everyday life that put stress on your plantar fascia as well. Working a job that requires standing for most of the day, for example, or walking a long commute in flat dress shoes or high heels.</p>
<p>In shoes with good arch support, especially when combined with orthotic insoles for plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia has a cushioned structure that allows the tissue to keep its natural shape no matter how hard the ground, instead of stretching and straining to remain stable.</p>
</div>
<h2>SYMPTOMS OF PLANTAR FASCIITIS</h2>
<div>
<p>Symptoms include sharp pain and inflammation across the bottom of your foot, specifically near the heel. You’ll most likely feel it when you first get out of bed, or after a day spent on your feet – particularly if you stand on hard surfaces for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>If your pain is relatively new, walking and working the muscles of your feet may provide relief temporarily. Plantar fasciitis discomfort usually flares up first thing in the morning because the plantar fascia tissue on the bottom of the foot can tighten and contract while you sleep. Unless your prone to sleepwalking or kicking off the covers, your feet are at rest overnight, giving the plantar fascia time to settle into a less protracted state. Taking your first steps out of bed in the morning stretches the “rubber band” which can trigger pain.</p>
<p>The same thing can happen even after sitting for just an hour or two. The worst of the soreness may have appeared to subside but as soon as you get on your feet again, it returns with a vengeance.</p>
<p>As the inflammation gets worse, the pain becomes increasingly constant throughout the day. Not only running and walking but even just standing can be excruciating and unbearable.</p>
<p>It is important to make sure the pain in your foot is in fact plantar fasciitis and not something else that may feel similar but actually requires a different set of treatments.</p>
<p>One common source of discomfort in that area of the foot is bruising of the fat pad that protects your heel bone and cushions each step. This usually comes from stepping on something sharp or hard and can be treated simply by giving your heel extra cushion and resting your foot as often as possible. Once the bruising has had time to heal, you’ll be pain free! If only plantar fasciitis were so easy.</p>
<p>Sometimes tendonitis (inflammation in the tendons that connect muscles to bones) in the heel area can be confused with plantar fasciitis. If the pain stems from the back of your foot near your Achilles tendon or the lower inside area near the arch of your foot, the pain is more than likely affecting your tendons, not your plantar fascia. If you feel stinging on the underside of your foot where your heel bone meets your arch tissue, there is a good chance it’s plantar fasciitis.</p>
</div>
<h2>HOW TO TREAT PLANTAR FASCIITIS PAIN</h2>
<div>
<p>The most obvious, if not always doable, way to immediately help relieve plantar fasciitis pain is to decrease the load on your feet. In other words, stay off your feet as much as possible. However, for many people, it’s simply not feasible to sit and relax most of the day. Reducing the load on your feet, and therefore lessening the strain on your plantar fascia, can start with small things like switching your daily run to a daily bike ride or taking the bus to work instead of walking, if possible.</p>
<p>In conjunction with giving your feet a rest, there are a few <span style=""color: rgb(43, 0, 255);""><a title=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"" href=""https://www.superfeet.com/blog/best-stretches-and-exercises-for-plantar-fasciitis-relief"" style=""color: rgb(43, 0, 255);"">plantar fasciitis stretches</a></span> and muscle strengthening exercises that can relieve pain and help prevent future injury. Stretching the plantar fascia while massaging the pain point, stretching and training your calves and even “toe yoga” can all help treat plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>Staying off your feet and stretching when possible will certainly help you heal, but what about the times when walking or running are unavoidable? Is there a way to put force on your plantar fascia without causing more pain? The answer is yes, with the right support.</p>
<p>One of the best things you can do to not only treat your pain in the short term but also prevent it from coming back in the future is to invest in the right pair of <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/products/casual-pain-relief"">plantar fasciitis inserts</a>. Because the plantar fascia is the main structure making up the arch of your foot, keeping it properly supported is key. An insole constructed using soft foam combined with durable arch support not only cushions the foot but keeps it stable and supported in its natural shape, even when standing for long hours on hard surfaces.</p>
</div>
<h2>HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST INSOLES FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS PAIN</h2>
<div>
<p>Not all insoles are created equal. Orthotics for plantar fasciitis usually have both cushioned foam for comfort and strong arch support for stability. The softness of cheap gel inserts may be appealing for temporary relief but won’t solve the problem, while orthotics prescribed by a podiatrist may offer a custom fit but are expensive and may only work in certain shoes.</p>
<p>Important things to consider when choosing plantar fasciitis insoles are the fit, support, shock absorption, size, material and volume. While the highest priority is to find what is most comfortable under your feet, these six attributes can help you narrow down your search and decide what will work best for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>FIT</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finding the right fit is central to choosing an insole. Some are made for very arched feet while others work for those flatter-footed among us. An insole should feel supportive but not intrusive and help keep the foot aligned in its natural shape.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>SUPPORT</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Speaking of a foot’s natural shape, proper arch support is one of the most important things to keep in mind when buying a plantar fasciitis insole. A durable cap that cradles the heel and extends the length of the arch will keep the plantar fascia tissue from straining during each step.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>SHOCK ABSORPTION</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>While firm, structured support is great at keeping the plantar fascia in its natural shape, shock-absorbing foam is also essential to counteract the hard surfaces most people walk on every day and keep your feet feeling oh so comfortable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>SIZE</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ideally, your insoles fit perfectly under your feet and in your favorite shoes. Luckily, Superfeet insoles are trim-to-fit, meaning you can match them exactly to the liners that come in your shoes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>MATERIAL</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The materials your insoles are made from are important to consider for a variety of reasons. They not only determine how the insole will feel immediately but also its long-term durability. Certain materials can provide extra benefits like antibacterial properties and odor control as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>VOLUME</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>No, this doesn’t refer to the sound an insole makes when you take a step (for the record, if your insoles are making sounds, something’s wrong!). The volume of an insole is how much space it takes up in your shoe. Insoles with the thickest foam and highest arch are meant for roomier footwear while thin insoles can fit in tight-fitting shoes.</p>
</div>
<h2>THE BEST INSOLES FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS – RELIEVING PLANTAR FASCIA PAIN</h2>
<div>
<p>Superfeet insoles’ <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/the-science-of-superfeet"" title=""https://www.superfeet.com/pages/the-science-of-superfeet"">contoured shape</a> stabilizes the feet, helping reduce some of the stress on the plantar fascia. The structured heel cup positions the soft tissue under the heel bone to help reduce the effect of impact forces on the already inflamed structure.

<p>At 1,442 square miles in size, Olympic National Park is larger than Rhode Island by 200 square miles, over half the size of Delaware, nearly twice as large as Great Smoky Mountain National Park, and 300 square miles larger than Yosemite. One road surrounds the park and to drive around the entire park takes nearly six full hours with no stops. Olympic National Park is also home to 49 peaks over 6,500 feet, many of which are rarely climbed due to difficult terrain and isolation. Over 600 miles of trails are waiting to be explored and enjoyed, the majority of which are designated wilderness by the National Park Service.</p>
<h2>2. Glaciers</h2>
<p>Olympic National Park is home to 266 glaciers spread throughout the park. Blue Glacier, located on Mount Olympus, is 2.6 miles long and is estimated to be the size of 20 trillion ice cubes.<br><br></p>

<h2>
<br>3. Animals</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception about the Olympic National Park. While the region is known for amazing rain forests, incredible mountain peaks, gorgeous beaches and salmon stocked rivers, few people actually come to visit the park for its wide range of animals. Usually, if people want to see wild animals they travel to Yellowstone National Park. However, before you make that trek, check out the amazingly abundant wildlife right here on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
<p>From the Roosevelt elk, which are the basis for the founding of the Olympic National Park, to the marmots, slugs, flying squirrels and salamanders that are endemic to the Olympic Peninsula, the region is alive with hundreds of different animals.</p>
<h2>4. Beaches</h2>
<p>The beaches of Olympic National Park are some of the best in the world, but not for those who like to lay on pristine sections of coast with warm waters. Olympic’s beaches are rocky, craggy, full of sea life, and provide amazing hiking opportunities. Complete with some of the most picturesque sea-stacks in the world, these beaches make for great storm watching on rainy days and amazing hiking on sunny days. Depending on the season, whales, both gray and Orca, are visible from every beach. From LaPush to Shi Shi and the popular Ruby Beach, each and every visitor that sets their sights on the Washington Coast will fall in love with it. Whether you are looking for a day hike, a backpacking trip, or an amazing place to catch the sunrise, few places compare to the Pacific Coast of Olympic National Park.</p>
<h2>5. Rainforests</h2>
<p>Technically, the western edge of Olympic National Park is one rainforest, but locals have broken these rainy, temperate forests into three distinct rainforests; the Hoh, Queets, and Quinault.</p>
<p>The Hoh Rainforest is the most famous, with moss-covered trees, short and flat hiking trails, and over 120 inches of rain falling annually. Bobcat, bear and elk can be seen along creeks, gorging themselves on salmon who've returned to their spawning grounds upstream. For the more adventurous, the Hoh Rainforest is where you can summit the tallest peak in the park, Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>The Queets rainforest is the most remote and less visited rainforest region in Olympic National Park. With up to 140 inches of rain, the Queets Rainforest is where every drop of rain falls before the clouds off the Pacific Ocean rise of the mighty Mount Olympus. If you want to be alone in a rainforest, this is where you must go.</p>
<p>The Quinault Rainforest is one of the classic destinations for tourists looking to get away from the more popular Hoh Rainforest region. With 120 inches of a rain a year, this wet, damp, moss-covered forest is home to black bears, salmon, eagles, waterfalls and incredible backpacking trips, exploring the Quinault Rainforest should be at the top of everyone’s list.</p>
<h2>6. Lakes, Rivers and Waterfalls</h2>
<p>Olympic National Park consists of water, so the rivers, lakes and waterfalls of the region serve as the life-force. High alpine lakes, like Lake of the Angels and the Seven Lakes Basin region are sought after hiking and backpacking destinations. If isolated lakes aren’t what you enjoy, Lake Crescent and Lake Quinault are fantastic lakes in the park. Lake Crescent, near to great hiking, kayaking and camping is the second deepest lake in Washington State, estimated to be over 1,000 feet deep in places. Lake Quinault isn’t nearly that deep, but it is home to great views, a classic old lodge, and it's close to the mountains, the rainforest and the ocean.</p>
<p>The most famous rivers of the region are the Hoh, the Elwha, the Quinault and the Queets, but many smaller rivers also support life. With a healthy salmon population, the rivers are popular with anglers of all abilities, but fishing in the park is not allowed. The rivers in the park are wild, carving canyons through rugged terrain and creating breathtaking and remote waterfalls. Service Falls, along the Queets River, has yet to be explored on foot, thanks in part to a prohibitive 200 hundred foot canyon.</p>
<p>The waterfalls of Olympic National Park are hands-down, some of the most beautiful waterfalls you will see. With over 100 inches of rain falling throughout the majority of the park, water seems to be flowing from everywhere, cascading down every nook and cranny. From the iconic three tiered waterfall of Sol Duc to the beautiful roadside falls of the Quinault and everything in between, if you love waterfalls, you will love the Olympics.</p>
<h2>7. Hiking</h2>
<p>It is hard to imagine hiking anywhere more beautiful than Olympic National Park, and once you step foot on the over 600 miles of trails, you will get hooked. From low land hikes along gorgeous beaches and dense rainforests to summiting isolated peaks or walking along treeless ridges that allow you to see to the ends of the earth, the views and experience one gets from hiking the Olympics are arguably some of the best in the nation. Other parks may have good beach trails, or great hikes along rivers or lakes, but Olympic has it all.</p>
<h2>8. Isolation</h2>
<p>Olympic National Park is one of the most isolated places in America, home to the 'Quietest Square Inch in the States'. While some trails can get crowded by local standards, visitors who have experienced the masses at Yosemite, Yellowstone or the rim of the Grand Canyon will feel isolated and far removed from society. With Seattle being hours away, few take the time to hit the trails in Olympic. Aside from a few summer days, only the heartiest of visitors will venture further than a half mile down the trails of the region, letting you have the majority of the park to yourself year round.</p>

<p>In a city like Chattanooga, filled with so many outdoor adventures, you're missing out if you aren't partaking in the outdoor fun in at least some way. And trail running is one of the most approachable and enjoyable activities you can choose in the Scenic City.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not the most avid runner and you’re not sure how to start. Or maybe you’ve been a long-time roadrunner but you’d like to transition to the trails. Whatever it is, here are a few tips to help you get started and get out on Chattanooga's world class trail systems. You'll be glad you did!</p>
<p><strong>1. Protect Your Feet</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Get fitted for a good pair of shoes. If you're going to start on a wood-chip or packed dirt path, your regular running shoes will do. You can actually use them on most of the beginner trails recommended here, but trail running shoes are a good idea. When you trail run, you move more laterally, so you'll need more ankle stability because there are roots and rocks to navigate, and trail shoes have better outsoles to improve your traction; this is key for rocky and slippery routes. Salomon, Hoka One One, La Sportiva, and New Balance are all great options.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stay Hydrated</strong></p>
<p>Get a handheld bottle for shorter runs or a hydration pack with a belt for longer ones. Take it with you because you might be on the trail longer than you plan, and you’ll have less access to public water sources. Many packs also include pockets for nutrition, so you can carry an energy gel, bar, or food. It’s always a good idea to carry along some sort of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>3. Orient Yourself </strong></p>
<p>Know where you’re going. It’s a good idea to study a map and have an idea of the trail. Carry a phone in your pack to reference the trail recommendations on RootsRated. It’s also helpful for keeping in contact with family if necessary. Begin on easier paths and walk or run for only 15 to 20 minutes during your first outing. Increase your time and/or distance by about 10 percent each week. This is a good way to begin learning the trails so you have confidence about where you’re going and what you’ll be running on.</p>
<p><strong>4. Take Your Time </strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Go slow, pick up your feet, and don’t be afraid to hike if you have to. The two biggest mistakes new trail runners make is trying to run too fast and failing to pick up their feet. Don’t think about time or pace, especially if you are transitioning from road to trail. You’ll be running slower because the terrain will be more demanding. You want to be running slowly enough that you could carry on a conversation if you had company. Plan to go for a certain amount of time and think about simply doing an out and back.</p>
<p>Practice running on different terrain. Bruises, cuts, wounds, and twisted ankles come from not lifting your feet properly. If you slow down and lift your feet, staying upright will be much easier. If you're losing running motivation on a steep hill, walk. Don’t feel bad about that. Even experienced trail racers walk at times. You should also walk if you're approaching a tricky obstacle like a stream or log. The more time you spend on the trail, the more comfortable you will feel.</p>
<p><strong>5. Pay Attention</strong></p>
<p>When you’re in the woods, there is always something to see. Take in the views, the interesting trees, and the animals all around you. Keep your eyes moving. You don’t want to take your eyes off the ground in front of you for long, but you also don’t want to miss out on your surroundings. Plan to survey the ground in front of you as you’re running in order to prepare for each stride. Paying attention to the trail surfaces will help you maintain your pace and avoid an unpleasant face plant.</p>
<p><strong>6. Have Fun</strong></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>This includes getting dirty. Enjoy whatever nature sends your way, especially when it comes to the weather. There isn’t a thing you can do about it anyway. Trail running is fundamental and grounding. You can feel like a kid again as you move through the woods, over roots, rocks and downed trees while you improve you balance, agility and coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few excellent places to go in the Chattanooga area: </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The <a href=""http://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/guild-hardy-trail"" title=""http://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/guild-hardy-trail"">Guild Trail</a>, on Lookout Mountain, is a great starter trail that has stable footing and gradual climbs for 6.5 miles of rolling terrain. You can turn around any time and not worry about getting lost.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong> At <a href=""http://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/enterprise-south-trail-running"" title=""http://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/enterprise-south-trail-running"">Enterprise South Nature Park</a>, virtually any of the pedestrian trails will be perfect for a beginner. There are some hills though, so be prepared to walk.</p>
<p>3. Finally, <a href=""http://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/stringers-ridge-trail-running"" title=""ttp://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/trail-running/stringers-ridge-trail-running"">Stringers Ridge</a>, just minutes from downtown, offers miles of smooth singletrack that weaves in all sorts of exciting directions, over easily-scaled uphills and down speedy descents. The wider outer trails are perfect for beginners.</p>

"589637058743","exploring-yellowstone-national-park-in-winter","MERGE","Exploring Yellowstone National Park in Winter","Superfeet","<p>As one of America's most-visited National Parks, Yellowstone is most-often seen in the summer months, when the prairies are golden and the signs of winter are a far off memory. Full of world-class backpacking, hiking, and animal watching, many who visit the park feel that Yellowstone doesn't get any better than visiting during the summer months. Once November rolls around, however, when most of the park roads close and the crowds all but evaporate, this is when those who are in-the-know flock to the park, ready to experience the unique and awe-inspiring sights of Yellowstone in the chilly months.</p>
<p>For some, visiting Yellowstone in the off-season might initially sound intimidating. But in reality, a visit to Yellowstone in winter is easy, beautiful, and well worth the drive. In winter, when feet of snow, howling winds, and subfreezing temperatures are typically signs to avoid areas, this formidable stretch of land in the Rocky Mountains becomes a paradise of snow-filled wonderment. If you haven't seen America's first National Park in winter, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences in the world.</p>
<p>What makes winter in Yellowstone so amazing isn't the hiking or camping. Instead, it is witnessing the transformation of the cold season on this incredible landscape. In the winter, animal watching becomes second to none, with herds of bison, elk, and deer easily standing out against the white snow blanketing the rolling hills and mountains. As the temperature drops, the hot springs, geysers, and thermal regions emit more steam, showing off the lurking wonders of this huge super volcano bubbling just below the surface. Accessed by car, snow coach, or snowmobile, visiting Yellowstone when it is covered in snow will leave you forever changed, connected to this region in a way that only a handful of visitors experience each year.</p>
<p>By far, the highlight for most Yellowstone visitors is found along the road between Gardiner, Montana, and Cooke City. Most who visit Yellowstone in the winter find themselves staying at the hotels in either city, giving them easy access to the park's winter hiking and wildlife watching. Passing through Mammoth and the world-famous wildlife watching destination of Lamar Valley, this is the only stretch of road open to cars. While the bears may be hibernating, the rest of the animals of the park can be seen easily against the stark white background, letting eager visitors watch moose, bighorn sheep, foxes, otters, coyotes, elk, bison, and wolves.</p>
<p>The best way to see animals in the winter is to hop in your car just before sunrise, heading out to the Lamar Valley from Mammoth Hot Springs. Along the road, keep an eye out for any movement and/or people standing out along the road with spotting scopes and binoculars. During the winter months, wolf researchers and wildlife enthusiasts are commonly seen driving back and forth, scanning and listening for wolf packs. Be patient and it's possible you might see a pack of wolves with the help of these experts.</p>
<p>Animals are wild and although sightings can't be predicted, there is a routine that they tend to follow, helping increase your potential to see most of the active animals in the park. Elk and bison will be everywhere, while moose are commonly seen near Pebble Creek on the way to Cooke City. Bighorn Sheep tend to hang out near the bridge spanning the Yellowstone River, while otters are usually spotted along the Lamar River near Soda Butte. To see foxes and coyotes, head out to the Lamar Valley and drive toward Cooke City. Chances are, you'll see numerous coyotes and the occasional fox hunting and jumping in the snowdrifts.</p>
<hr>
<p>For wolves, look no further than driving out to Lamar Valley. Visitors who are patient and wake up early will see a sight usually only found in nature documentaries or in a National Geographic magazine. In Lamar Valley, find the wolf experts and wait. You might just hear a howl fill the air, breaking the silence of winter. If you are lucky, the howl will occur near a herd of elk, giving you a chance to see a pack of wolves charging and systematically finding the weakest elk. Every so often, wolf watchers will get to watch the wolves bring down an elk and revel in their successes by howling and feasting, surviving for another week in the winter conditions.</p>
<p>Starting in Gardiner, pass though the Roosevelt Arch and drive to Mammoth, where recreation activities abound. Along the Gardiner River, between the city and Mammoth, there is access to a hot springs where you can take a dip in the warm waters, surrounded by the cold snow. For most winter visitors, Mammoth gives you the easiest option for winter hiking.</p>
<p>Park at the visitor center to enjoy a snowy jaunt around Mammoth Hot Springs, which showcases the geothermal beauty of this iconic Yellowstone region. The upper loop of Mammoth Hot Springs is perfect for cross country skiing and snowshoeing, while the lower boardwalks give day hikers of any age a wonderful trek around this wonder of the world. Once you have hiked the incredibly gorgeous hot springs, head toward the Roosevelt intersection where you turn left to get to Lamar Valley. From the closed gate at Roosevelt, you can hike up the closed road and enjoy the spectacular sights of Tower Falls and the Yellowstone River in the snowy bliss. The views down river from the road and boardwalks are impossibly beautiful.</p>
<p>The Mammoth Area is also one of the regions where you can catch a snow coach to get to Old Faithful and see the hidden sections of Yellowstone in winter. The other area to access Old Faithful and the interior of the park is from West Yellowstone. Here, you can also sign up for snowmobile tours to see the park in unrivaled solitude and beauty. Both options are great if you have reservations at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, where you can be one of a few dozen people to roam the geyser basin when it is wrapped in a snowy blanket. The lodges book up early every year, making this a tough destination if you haven't planned in advance. That is why most stay in Cooke City or Gardiner, as those towns have plenty of amenities and tend to have rooms available year round.</p>
<p>Visiting Yellowstone National Park in the winter is a unique experience, allowing you to see hot springs draped in snow, herds of bison with icicles clinging to their beards, and rarely-seen wolves hunting elk. This is the time of year when it's easy to imagine what this environment must have looked like before the comforts of modern society began to creep within the park boundaries; when wildlife and wilderness reigned supreme throughout the wide-open expanses of this vast caldera. Whether you drive through Lamar Valley, take a slowcoach to Old Faithful, or experience the park on the back of a snowmobile, seeing Yellowstone in winter will forever change your outlook on this gorgeous national park.</p>

<h3>Are Superfeet women's specific products the same as other Superfeet insoles, just smaller?</h3>
<p>The short answer: no (we didn't shrink the insoles and make them pink).</p>
<p>Superfeet women's-specific products feature the naturally supportive energizing foundation of the <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/en-us/pages/why-superfeet/"">Superfeet shape</a>, just like all Superfeet insoles.</p>
<p>However, the size and proportions of the shape are different for Superfeet women's specific products.</p>
<p>It's important to remember, no two feet are alike — not even your own. In general, women's feet are usually much more narrow. The same goes for women's footwear. The inside surface of a women's shoe (where the Superfeet insole will sit) has a narrower overall width. For those reasons — the width of the typical female foot and women's footwear in general — Superfeet women's-specific insoles are narrower than unisex Superfeet insoles.</p>
<p>Additionally <a href=""https://www.japmaonline.org/doi/abs/10.7547/0990383?journalCode=apms"">the arch length of a woman's foot is shorter in proportion the overall length of the foot</a>, compared to a man's foot. Generally, women's heels also tend to also be slimmer in relation to the width of the forefoot, and lower in overall volume than a man's foot. These anatomical dimensions and proportions are designed into Superfeet women's specific insoles.</p>
<h3>Can men wear women's-specific Superfeet products?</h3>
<p>Absolutely (and vice versa - women can wear non women's-specific products)! Superfeet insoles labeled women's-specific are just that: a label, designed to help you find the right product for you. When you see ""women's-specific"" know that it means that insole is narrower and has a proportionally shorter arch length and slimmer heel than the unisex version of the insole. If that describes your foot shape, try it —it might be a better fit for you.</p>
<h3>Why does the size and shape of women's insoles matter?</h3>
<p>Because foot health is an essential part of your overall well-being. What you wear on your feet <a href=""https://www.superfeet.com/en-us/news/why-comfort-is-key-when-it-comes-to-runners-and-footwear/"">has a big influence on your overall health and wellness</a>.

"589636993207","10-of-the-best-running-songs-of-all-time","MERGE","10 of the Best Running Songs of All Time","Superfeet","<img>Nothing can up your running game quite like a killer soundtrack. When the hills get steep and the headwinds get strong, a good jam coming through your headphones can make it that much easier to put one foot in front of the other. That being said, a solid running soundtrack should definitely feature at least one running-related song and it's even more fun if you think about the lyrics literally, as if they're really about your marathon training.
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Of course, some ""running"" songs are better suited to actually running than others. We rated songs according to our very not at all scientific Run Rating System, which takes into account a song's run-related lyrics, the peppiness of its pace, and whether it's worth rocking out to on your daily runs. (Extra points assigned for any related running-adjacent trivia.) Read on for 10 of the best running songs out there.</p>
<h2>1. ""Runnin' Down a Dream"" | Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</h2>
<p>Legendary rocker Tom Petty knew all about running down his dreams—he dropped out of high school to join his first band. This single from his 1989 record <em>Full Moon Fever</em> is a classic, and plenty of pro athletes have run along to it. It was twice the theme for the NBA finals, and Petty played it at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2008. Run Rating: 7</p>
<h2>2. ""Take It On the Run"" | REO Speedwagon</h2>
<p>No matter where you are when it comes on, this is one of those songs you can't help but sing along to. Since its release in 1981, ""Take It On the Run"" spent has spent its share of time atop the Billboard charts; it's a classic rock staple. In fact, there's not a single track on <em>Hi Infidelity</em> that'll let you down. Run Rating: 10</p>
<h2>3. ""Against the Wind"" | Bob Seger</h2>
<p>You may not always feel young and strong when you're running against the wind, but it's tough to beat the song that served as the soundtrack to Forrest Gump's iconic cross-country run. See if you can sound as good as Eagles members Don Henley and Glenn Frey when you sing backup with the wind in your hair. Run Rating: 8</p>
<h2>4. ""Friend of the Devil"" | The Grateful Dead</h2>
<p>The pace of this uber-classic Grateful Dead song is perfect for a slow recovery jog, despite that its narrator is on the run from both the law and the devil himself. ""I set out running but I take my time"" is a perfect philosophy for those days where you're not feeling super-motivated, but know a run will do you good even if it's a little off your average pace. Run Rating: 6</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. ""Ready to Run"" | The Dixie Chicks</h2>
<p>This upbeat single from the Dixie Chicks' 1999 <em>Fly</em> is more about running away from commitment than running for fun, but that doesn't stop it from being a great warm-up soundtrack. The year it came out, it was featured in <em>Runaway Bride</em> with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere and also won a Grammy. Run Rating: 9</p>
<h2>6. ""Born to Run"" | Bruce Springsteen</h2>
<p>Bruce Springsteen's 1975 single has become so synonymous with the American icon that his 2016 autobiography has the same name. As with many big undertakings (like marathon training, for example), this one took lots of blood, sweat, and tears—Springsteen spent more than six months perfecting it in the studio. Run Rating: 9</p>
<h2>7. ""Running"" | No Doubt</h2>
<p>Ska is practically meant for moving your body around, which means No Doubt's catalog is the perfect soundtrack to hit the road to. Maybe Gwen Stefani's doing it on purpose—she's an avid runner. This one's a little slower, but it's still a solid choice for a cool-down. Run Rating: 5</p>
<h2>8. ""Run-Around"" | Blues Traveler</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a catchy, familiar tune is all it takes to get you up that monster hill or through the last few miles of your workout. ""Run-Around"" is exactly that: its quick tempo and enthusiastic delivery make it impossible not to pick up your feet. The whole album, <em>Four</em>, is great for a tempo run or speed work. Run Rating: 8</p>
<h2>9. ""Take the Money and Run"" | Steve Miller Band</h2>
<p>This 70s hit is a classic road trip song—in fact, that was Miller's intention when he wrote and recorded it—but it's perfect for when you're literally running, too. After all, there's no motivation to pick up the pace quite like being on the run from the law, Bonnie-and-Clyde style. Its buoyant rhythm guarantees you'll still be motoring along by the end of your run. Run Rating: 10</p>
<h2>10. ""Long Train Runnin'"" | The Doobie Brothers</h2>
<p>It would be hard not to get pumped up by this song's opening guitar riff. ""Long Train Runnin'"" was a Top 10 Billboard hit, but the band played it at their live shows for about three years before they got around to recording it. It just goes to show that, like your training runs, the best songs are a little different every time. Run Rating: 9</p>

"589636960439","mountains-and-the-beach-5-destinations-where-you-can-have-both","MERGE","Mountains and the Beach: 5 Destinations Where You Can Have Both","Superfeet","<p>For some, summer vacation means sunning on a beach, and watching the waves with a cocktail in hand. For others—perhaps your family members—the perfect break means hitting the trails to mountain peaks. Most destinations make families choose between hills and shores. But these five destinations combine the best of both. Meet the Goldilocks of summer vacation destinations, with a little bit of water, a little bit of altitude, and a lot that goes just right.</p>
<h2>1. Ventura County, California</h2>
<p>Ojai and Ventura host the annual Mountains 2 Beach Marathon for good reason: Mountain hiking and the classic California coastline lie within, well, 26.2 miles of each other. Located northwest of Los Angeles, Ojai sits in a valley, and the village is dotted with art galleries, farmers markets, and high-desert hikes in the nearby Los Padres National Forest. Trails meander through scrubland, sometimes revealing cascading waterfalls, as along the Rose Valley Falls Trail, when the season is right. But for waves, visitors head downhill to the city of Ventura, a classic coastal town. Most beachgoers head to San Buenaventura State Park and take in the views along the iconic wooden Ventura Pier.</p>
<h2>2. Astoria, Oregon</h2>
<p>This charming coastal town sits at the estuary of the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean. It’s probably most famous as the filming location of the 1980s film The Goonies. Film fans will recognize Haystack Rock, a vertical rock formation right off the beach, which was featured in the movie and is an iconic view along the beach in Astoria. The Pacific’s waters are bracing, so you may not last long swimming or surfing here. Still, the Pacific Northwest’s beaches have a picturesque quality that can’t be found elsewhere. Hiking trails are just outside the village’s backdoor: The Cathedral Tree-Coxcomb Hill Trail, for example, starts at a 300-year-old Sitka spruce and climbs 164 stairs to take in views of the town, the Coastal Range, and the Pacific Ocean. Other routes lead to lighthouses, along the Columbia River, and through coastal rainforests.</p>
<hr>
<div></div>
<h2>3. The Big Island, Hawaii</h2>
<p>Officially named Hawaii, the Big Island is one of the lesser visited in this archipelago, but it’s arguably the best for outdoorsy folks. While you can lounge on white sandy beaches, there’s so much more to do on the island. Its diverse terrain includes green sand at Papakolea and black sand at Punalu’u. The reefs just offshore at Hapuna Beach and Kahalu’u Beach Park are popular for snorkeling. The island is the biggest among the Hawaiian islands, and it continues to grow daily thanks to two active volcanoes that continue to shape its size and terrain. Hiking trails take visitors across coastal dunes, shrublands, thick rainforests, high alpine deserts, and, yes, along the active volcanoes. The Hilina Pali Trail, for example, takes a 7-mile route down the side of the Kilauea volcano.</p>
<h2>4. Virginia Beach, Virginia</h2>
<p>This southeastern Virginia town is as classic coastal as it gets. A three-mile boardwalk stretches along the oceanfront. The broad sandy shores beckon visitors for sandcastle building, sunning, and wading into the waves. This locale marks an important piece of United States history, too: First Landing State Park is where the Jamestown colonists arrived from England in 1607. Reaching the mountains from here requires a bit of a road trip, but the four-hour drive is well worth it to reach Shenandoah National Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains. You can head to the southern entrance at Rockfish Gap or the northern entrance at Front Royal, and follow the 150-mile Skyline Drive in between with multiple Appalachian Trail hikes jutting off this spine.</p>
<h2>5. Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada</h2>
<p>You don’t have to head to the coasts to get miles of shoreline. Lake Tahoe has 75 miles of shoreline with several sandy beaches at points between. Destinations like Sand Harbor Beach offer wide expanses of sand, freshwater swimming areas, and beach coves dedicated to snorkelers and SCUBA divers. Paddle sports are accessible on the lake, and you can rent kayaks, canoes, and stand-up paddleboards so you can get out on the water. You may even want to join a yoga SUP class. Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in the U.S., so the pine-studded hills of the Sierra Nevadas practically tumble into the waters. That means hiking is close at hand. The Rubicon Trail traces the shores of Emerald Bay and features incredible panoramic views, cliffs, coves, waterfalls, and even a lighthouse along the 13-mile round-trip outing. Destinations like these are sure to be crowd pleasers, whether you’re looking for mountains or beaches.</p>

<p><em>Written By: Bill Reifsnyder — Superfeet Wellness Panel Member. Bill Reifsnyder is the founder of <a href=""../../../../../en-us/news/5k-running-training-plan-for-intermediate-runners"">Camp Runabout</a>, the only adult summer camp for runners on the planet, and is committed to helping runners of all ages and abilities achieve their goals and get the most out of their training plans. Bill is a former professional runner and holds the thrid fastest time ever run by an American for 10 miles (46:32).</em><span><span> </span></span><br><br>Whether you are new to the sport of running or you have been running for years and are stuck in a rut, understanding the different types of running workouts and their purposes are essential. As a coach, I have had many, many folks come to me in a quandary, “I run five miles every day, and I never get faster!” These runners typically think I am a magician when I incorporate interval workouts and tempo runs (see below) into their program and all of a sudden they are setting PRs.</p>
<p>Here are six different types of running workouts that serve different purposes. All of these workouts are important and will help you achieve your running goals.</p>
<h2>Base Runs</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build aerobic capacity and endurance</em></p>
<p>Base runs are going to make up the majority of your training regimen. They are “maintenance workouts”; short-to-medium length runs done at a comfortable pace — your base aggregates day after day, week after week, year after year. Your base training is essential because it is upon it that the rest of your training sits. Picture your training program as a pyramid, and the broader your base, the higher the peak you can achieve.</p>
<h2>Hill Repeats</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build strength and power<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_01-en-1556143930.jpg""><br></em></p>
<p>A form of interval training run over hill and dale, hill repeats are performed early in the season to create strength and power. I look for a hill that is approximately a quarter mile in length and has a 5-degree grade. Your hill can be shorter, but keep the grade around 5%. After your warm-up, begin your workout by sprinting up the hill and jogging/walking down. Repeat as many times as desired depending on your fitness level and goal. Oh, and don’t forget to warm-down afterward.</p>
<h2>Speed Workout</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build speed and running efficiency</em></p>
<p>For many, speed workouts, or interval training, are not the “fun part” of running. They will hurt a little (or a lot), but the benefits are well worth the pain. Intervals are meant to build speed and running efficiency. Typically, interval training is performed on the track, but if you don’t have access to a track, or it’s snow-covered, these runs can be done almost anywhere. Heck, I have done speed workouts in the mall parking lot and the halls of our local elementary school after hours (you have to know someone for this one).<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_03_tempo-en-1556144072.jpg""></p>
<p>Interval training consists of short bursts of high-intensity running followed by periods of recovery (jog or walk). Here is a speed workout example:</p>
<p><em>2-mile warm-up • 8 x 400 meters with 2:00 recovery between each • 2-mile cool-down</em></p>
<p>Interval training will vary depending on your fitness level (early season versus late season), and the race distance for which you are training. If you are preparing for a 5K then your intervals will be shorter in length and faster. If you are training for a half marathon, your intervals will be longer, and pace will slow accordingly. Check out the Superfeet training programs for guidance. And remember, as my old coach used to say, “If you wanna run fast, you gotta run fast.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<div></div>
<h2>Tempo Runs</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build lactic acid tolerance</em></p>
<p>Tempo runs, also known as threshold runs, or anaerobic threshold runs, prepare you to run faster, farther without the sudden onset of fatigue. In other words, as you run faster and faster, you will eventually get to your anaerobic threshold, the point where your body can no longer supply your muscles with enough oxygen to maintain your effort, and lactic acid will begin to accumulate in your blood. You have seen this in your local race when your buddy goes out way too hard and crashes. It looks like a 300-pound bear jumped on his back, and he is attempting to carry him to the finish line. The good news is that you can improve your body’s ability to tolerate lactic acid with tempo runs.</p>
<p>A tempo run is typically 20 to 30 minutes in duration. The goal is to train right at, or as close to your anaerobic threshold as possible. This workout has a specific purpose and running faster than the predetermined pace will not get the job done. So how do you figure out your tempo run pace? You could have it measured in a lab where you run on a treadmill and they prick your finger over and over, measuring the lactic acid in your blood, as your run faster. But let’s be honest, how many people have a lab at their disposal, right? Alternatively, here are a couple of more practical methods to hone in on your tempo run pace:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your tempo run pace should be comfortably hard. You should be able to talk in short bursts, but you should not be able to speak in complete sentences.</li>
<li>Add 25-30 seconds per mile to your 5K pace.</li>
<li>If you have an HR monitor, your tempo run should be between 85% and 90% of your maximum heart rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of a tempo run is to lock in on the pace that coincides with your anaerobic threshold and keep it there for 20-30 minutes. With this in mind, I like to run tempo runs on a flat surface. It is hard to keep your pace and effort consistent when you are going up and down hills.</p>
<h2>Long Runs</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build endurance and mental confidence.</em></p>
<p>A weekly long run will improve your overall endurance and give you the mental confidence necessary on race day to complete the distance. Typically done on the weekend when you have a little more time to go out and pound the pavement, your long runs should be run at the same pace as your base runs. The length of your weekly long run will increase, as you get deeper into your training cycle. And your single longest run will vary depending on the distance of the race for which you are preparing. When possible, I like to get folks to do at least one run that covers the distance of your targeted race. This is not always possible when preparing for a marathon, but I would still like to see runners get up to the 22-24 mile range. Since you are going to be out on the roads or trails for an extended period, you’ll need to put a little more preparation into these workouts. It is essential to stay hydrated so carry some water (Camelbacks are great), have a friend ride a bike alongside you with water (my wife likes when I do this for her), or just know where the water fountains are along the way. You may also need a little energy while out on the course to prevent the dreaded bonk. Energy packets that come in a multitude of flavors are easily be stowed for consumption during your runs.</p>
<p><strong> <a href=""../../../../../en-us/insoles-and-sandals?filter=aftersport""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf__aftersport_blog_post_ad-en-1556139071.jpg""></a></strong></p>
<h2>Fartlek</h2>
<p><em>Purpose: Build speed and running efficiency in less structured format<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0638/5346/1687/files/19sf_wellness_blog_3_02-en-1556144009.jpg""><br></em></p>
<p>The Swedish word for “speed play,” fartlek is a less-structured form of interval training done on the roads. Fartlek involves alternating faster and slower periods of running during a base training session or long run. This is an excellent choice for runners who don’t have access to a track, newer runners who may be intimidated by the thought of running on a track, or runners who want the convenience of stepping out their front door to do some quality running. Here are a few examples of fartlek workouts.</p>
<h3>Workout #1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>5-mile warm up</li>
<li>2:00 minute hard/2:00 easy (repeat 10 times)</li>
<li>5-mile cool down</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workout #2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>5-mile warm up</li>
<li>3-4 miles of fartlek varying the distances. Pick a landmark in the distance (a telephone pole, a stop sign, etc. and run hard until you reach it. Then jog until you feel recovered and pick your next landmark.</li>
<li>5-mile cool down</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workout #3:</h3>
<ul>
<li>5-mile warm up</li>
<li>3-4 miles of fartlek, running hard on all uphills and easy on everything else. Obviously, you should choose a rolling course for this workout.</li>
<li>5-mile cool down</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no hard rules for fartlek running. Feel free to vary your workout to fit your specific training goals. If you are <a href=""../../../../../news/5k-running-training-plan-for-intermediate-runners"">training for a 5K</a>, your faster sections should be shorter in duration. If you are preparing for a half marathon or marathon, they should be longer.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br><br></p>

From the moment you slip them into your shoes, you can feel the difference.” AllOutdoor not only loved the plush cushioning but the support and durability as well. “The arch support is well-balanced, offering enough lift to support the arch without being overly rigid. This balance is crucial because it helps to distribute weight evenly across the foot, reducing strain on the arch and preventing discomfort. The insoles also have a reinforced base that adds to the overall support, ensuring that they maintain their shape and effectiveness over time.”</p>
