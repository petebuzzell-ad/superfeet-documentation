# General Notes about the Superfeet Shopify Platform

Prior to October 16, 2024, Superfeet.com was powered by Magento and was a multi-region site servicing US, Canada, and UK customers. They also had non-transactional regional sites for EU and Australia customers. 

When Arcadia Digital and CQL (the Shopify Plus development partner on the project) migrated the site to Shopify, we were forced to use regionally appropriate TLDs for each regional site instead of having all sites live on Superfeet.com. 

As such, we have Superfeet.ca (and superfeet.ca/fr) for our Canadian customers, Superfeet.co.uk for our UK customers, Superfeet.eu (non-transactional) for our EU customers, and Superfeet.com.au (non-transactional) for our AU customers. 

Since launching the Shopify site on Oct. 16, 2024, Arcadia Digital has been running Superfeet's eCommerce business and working closely with the brand's product & marketing teams to optimize the digital business and accelerate growth.
